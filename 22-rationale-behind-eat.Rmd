Whereas the previous chapter provided a *bona fide* overview of the growing consensus in integrating affective phenomena into computer-mediated learning environments, this chapter delves  more specifically into the rationale behind endowing learners with an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT), that is, the reasons why an EAT can be beneficial to learners. As briefly outlined in the previous chapter, an EAT does not only reckon that affective phenomena are important, but goes two steps further. First, it posits that they represent instrumental information from which learners can benefit individually or collectively. This means that learners can benefit from the conscious processing of emotional information: *becoming aware* of their emotions or that of their colleagues. Second, as the name implies, an EAT targets *emotion* as the affective phenomena capable of performing this information-oriented task, representing the *payload* from which learners may benefit. In other words, emotion is considered as a phenomenon that has a functional, teleological potential, which the EAT harness, but must also be able to manifest in the computer-mediated learning environment. This assumption is consistent with several perspectives to emotion that have gained widespread consensus in affective science in the last few decades, according to which emotion plays primarily, even if not exclusively, a functional role for the organism, both at the intra-personal and inter-personal levels [see among others @adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016; @frijdaEmotions1986; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999; @levensonIntrapersonalFunctionsEmotion1999; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018]. On the other hand, the instrumentality of an EAT depends upon a number of conditions at varios levels -- such as intra-personal, inter-personal, and technical -- that must interact for it to be effective.

This chapter thus provides an overview of different aspects, as well as their intrinsic complexity, that must be faced when considering the possibility of endowing a computer-mediated learning environment with explicit emotional awareness. First, it provides a provisional definition of emotion, which will be further developed in the next chapter, but that allows to better delimit the topic at hand. Then, the chapter illustrates some functions that the extant literature in affective science bestow to emotion, first at the intra-personal and then at the inter-personal level, which may be useful during a computer-mediated learning activity. Finally, combining information from the previous and present chapters, an abstract model of the functioning of an EAT is sketched out in an attempt to consider necessary and mediating factors, which determine its pertinence and usefulness for learners. The chapter concludes by advocating the benefits of considering a theory-driven perspective for the implementation of an EAT as a means to maximize its potential outcome.

## Provisonal Definition of Emotion

As stated previously, affective phenomena covers a wide range of phenomena that are considered, to various extent, as not *strictly*, or at least not *exclusively*, rational [@frijdaAffectPsychologicalPerspectives2009], and may comprise concepts such as preferences, dispositions, personal stances, moods, emotions, and feelings [@colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014; @pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005], but the list can be further extended, depending on how far disciplines or researchers stretch the boundaries of affect as a concept, or affective phenomena as a category. For instance, Pekrun and Linnerbrink-Garcia [@pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014, p. 2] point out that "[i]n the broader education literature, affect is often used to denote a broad variety of noncognitive constructs including emotion but also including self-concept, beliefs, motivation, and so on [...]. In contrast, in emotion research, affect refers to emotions and moods more specifically". Emotion definition will be discussed at length in the next chapter, but it is useful to draw at this point a provisional outline of the concept in a first attempt to delimit what emotional awareness is, or may be, about. Even if provisional, it is important to point out that the list is mainly driven by psychological perspective on emotion, that it not meant to be neither exhaustive nor detailed at this stage, and that not all scholars agree on attributing this features to emotion (or even the possibility to disentangle emotion from other affective phenomena). With these premises in mind, the list comprises X main features.

First, emotion is considered as an event of a relatively brief duration and object-focused, that is, related to a specific event 

Second, emotion is considered a two-step process

## Intra-Personal Function of Emotion

### Emotion and Cognition



### Emotion and Motivation

### Emotion and Regulation

## Inter-Personal Function of Emotion

The social and cultural function of emotion may therefore have been built upon a *feature* that has evolved particularly in some species, such as human beings, for which inter-personal relations are pivotal to survival and, less dramatically, well-being [@parkinsonEmotionSocialRelations2005; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999]. Keltner and Haidt [-@keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999] identify four level of analysis in which emotion play a social function: (1) the individual level, whenever the source of the emotion is of a social nature -- which, for some scholars, means most if not all of the time [@fischerWhereHaveAll2010; @parkinsonEmotionsAreSocial1996; @rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009]; (2) the dyadic level, such as in direct dialogue or collaboration; (3) the group-level, in which people share a common identities and goals to attain; and (4) the cultural level, where the analysis focus on macro-elements such as history and tradition. A recent overarching synthesis on the social function of emotions across all levels proposed by Fischer and Manstead [-@fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016] identifies two complementary, but distinct, functions performed by emotions: affiliation, and distancing. The affiliation function serves to form and maintain positive social relationship with others, whereas the distancing function helps in establishing and maintaining a social position relative to others. Other social functions of emotions, further developed below in the chapter, comprise the spontaneous tendency of people to share their emotions with others [@rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005], the use of emotional information to better understand behavior and appropriate conduct in social situations [@parkinsonEmotionsInterpersonalInteractions2010; @vankleefHowEmotionsRegulate2009], or situation in which people voluntary attempt to act upon emotions in others [@netzerInterpersonalInstrumentalEmotion2015; @reeckSocialRegulationEmotion2016; @zakiInterpersonalEmotionRegulation2013].

## Abstract Model of the Functions of an Emotion Awareness Tool

The information illustrated above, as well as in the previous chapter, can be integrated in an abstract model that depicts the functions allegedly carried out by an EAT. The proposed abstract model does not have the pretension to establish an absolute reference; on the contrary, it aims at visually implementing the different passages that are (or may be) assumed in the instrumentality of an EAT as a support to learning activities in computer-mediated environments. The model, depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:intro-thesis-scm-model-figure), take the perspective of a learner that disposes of an EAT in its computer-mediated learning environment. The model comprises boxes for four conceptual elements: (a) the learning activity, which may refer broadly to any computer-mediated environment implementing an instructional design; (b) intra-personal emotion, representing a single event or a set of events corresponding to the learners' expressed-displayed emotions; (c) inter-personal emotion, representing a single event or set of events corresponding to emotions expressed-displayed by other learners sharing the same environment, that the learner herself can therefore perceive-monitor; and (d) an overarching *meaning-making* process, which encompasses learner's effort to extrapolate instrumental information. The boxes are connected with directional arrows, numbered from 1 to 7, representing a series of processes that are (or may be) implicated in each passage. The numbers are used for identifying the passages, but do not imply a fixed order, even though some processes may be built upon previous passages. The section provides a discussion of each passage (*i.e.*, each numbered arrow) more specifically.

(ref:thesis-scm-caption) The EAT determines how an intra-personal emotion becomes inter-personal, and how the inter-personal emotions contribute to improve the shared understanding of the situation at hand. The situation may then trigger other intra-personal emotions.

### From the Learning Activity to Intra-Personal Emotion

Passage #1 goes from the learning activity to an intra-personal emotion, implicating that the learning activity elicits emotions in oneself. An EAT may intervene in this passage in several ways, grouped here in a non exhaustive lists of X phenomena labeled for illustration purpose as *emotion alertness* and *emotion conceptualization*.

Emotion alertness broadly refers to the fact that the presence of the EAT represents a general reminder about paying attention to emotion during the learning activity, and therefore may increase the *sensitivity* about emotional experience. In other words, the presence of the EAT may push learners to bestow to emotional self-awareness more attention that they would normally do without the presence of the EAT [@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. Emotion alertness may be induced to different degrees, depending on, for instance, whether the EAT is always available or not, and whether explicit prompts are frequently sent to learners [@csikszentmihalyiValidityReliabilityExperienceSampling2014; @shiffmanEcologicalMomentaryAssessment2008]. As an example, Molinari and colleagues [-@molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013] implemented an EAT into a computer-mediated collaborative task that reminded participants to self-report their emotions after five minutes since the last emotion expressed. 

Emotion alertness is not necessarily and automatically linked to concrete action of emotion display, that is, self-reporting the emotion into the system. In fact, even in the case of an increased alertness, learners could genuinely not feel any emotion, or decide not to express their emotion through the EAT for dispositional (*e.g.*, emotional expressivity, see @kringIndividualDifferencesDispositional1994) or contingent reasons (*e.g.*, bestow priority to the learning task at hand).

Emotion conceptualization broadly refers to the mechanisms by which learners are planned to self-report their emotions, which may vary greatly according to a number of theoretical and technical aspects. For instance, emotion self-report tools or questionnaires are very often divided in two categories, depending on whether they adopt a dimensional or a discrete perspective [@broekensAffectButtonMethodReliable2013; @fuentesSystematicLiteratureReview2017; @ritchieEvolutionSelfreportingMethods2016; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. 

In a dimensional approach, an emotion is conceptualized as a rating on a number of continuous criteria, among which the most frequently adopted ones are valence and arousal, but may also comprise dominance or, less frequently, other criteria 

In a discrete approach,

Less frequently, self-report tools attempt to combine the two approaches, as it is the case in the Geneva Emotion Wheel [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005], depicted in more details in the next chapter, or the Mood Meter application associated with the RULER approach [@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019] mentioned in the previous chapter. 

Depending on how emotion is conceptualized and, by extension, planned for self-report, the intra-personal awareness of emotion may be more or less (mis)guided, inducing learners to pay attention to some elements of their emotional experience that they will not necessarily consider in the same way, or with the same weight, depending on the specifics of the EAT at hand. 


### From Intra-Personal Emotion to Meaning-Making

Once an emotion or a set of emotions are self-reported, it is assumed that learners may extrapolate meaning from them. 

### From the Learning Activity to Inter-Personal Emotion

Passage #3 starts a complementary path with respect to passage #1, but from an inter-personal perspective, that is, concerning emotion in others learners sharing the same computer-mediated learning environment. This path may in fact be optional when the EAT is exclusively concerned with emotion self-awareness, whereas it becomes an integral part when the EAT is inspired from a Group Awareness Tool perspective. 

### From Inter-Personal Emotion to Meaning-Making

EASI model.
Normative use. 

### From Intra-Personal Emotion to Inter-Personal Emotion

Expression of emotion: emotion is made available to others depending on learners willingness to discole their emotional experience.

Emotion influence.

Emotion sharing.

### From Inter-Personal Emotion to Intra-Personal Emotion

Emotion comparison (e.g. affiliation or differentiation).
Emotion contagion.

### From Meaning-Making to the Learning Activity

Emotion is integrated into the learning activity, it modifies behavior (self-regulation, co-regulation, socially shared regulation).

Modification of learning activity can trigger another emotion, creating cycle.
