Imagine that you are co-authoring a text with a colleague for an upcoming assignment that you must submit in a course: you are at home, she can be anywhere in the world. You are using an online text processor, which allows you to edit the document simultaneously. This particular text editor has the feature of attributing animals names to authors, so that you are currently identified in the work-space as *anonymous hippo*, and your partner is *anonymous turtle*. The only thing you can see about the *turtle* is the flow of letters that stems from the position of her cursor in the document whenever she is typing on her keyboard, and *vice versa*. Imagine being in this situation: what kind of information about the *turtle* would you like to know to better assess how the learning task is going? And what kind of information about yourself would you like the *turtle* to know, for her to better assess how the learning task is going?

Now imagine that you are coding a project in an introductory programming course: you are facing lines of condensed and often mysterious syntax, whose execution sometimes results in the desired and celebrated outcome, but oftentimes leads to irking and obscure message errors. You are alone in front of your screen -- riddled with software you barely know and dozens of tabs in your browsers with results to hazardous research queries -- wondering whether your colleagues in the course are facing a similar fate. What information about them would help you better cope with this situation? What information about yourself would you like to share, which could be beneficial both to you and them?

You have certainly guessed from the title of the thesis that the answer put forward to these questions is: *emotions*. In the last few decades, emotions have been widely studied from different perspectives and with different methods, giving rise to the interdisciplinary field of affective sciences [e.g., @davidsonHandbookAffectiveSciences2003; @sanderOxfordCompanionEmotion2009]. A consistent body of research has corroborated the importance that affective phenomena -- such as emotions, feelings, motivations, moods, or preferences -- play in various circumstances of life, both individually and collectively, and at different levels of processing [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @armonyCambridgeHandbookHuman2013; @barrettHowEmotionsAre2018; @colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014; @damasioStrangeOrderThings2018; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016; @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013; @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018]. As a consequence of that, leading scholars in the field [@dukesRiseAffectivism2021] have recently considered legitimate to ask whether research has entered a new era -- the era of *affectivism* :

> The conceptual, methodological, and technical advances made within the last few decades have demonstrated that affective processes are unquestionably enlightening when it comes to understanding both behaviour and cognition. While it will ultimately be the responsibility of historians of science to determine whether or not a new era has begun, given the undeniable impact of affective sciences on our models of brain, mind, and behaviour, it seems relevant to ask today whether we are now in the era of affectivism. -- @dukesRiseAffectivism2021, p. 819

Even though the role of affect has received relatively little attention in learning and education in the past [@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005], there is nowadays a growing consensus in considering learning as the results of cognitive, social, and affective interactions [@bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018]. With respect to the role of affective phenomena more specifically, three intertwined research areas can be discerned. First, research investigating the effect of learning and teaching activities on learners' and teachers' affective experience [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013; @pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014]. Second, research that, conversely, focuses on the effect of affective phenomena on learning processes and outcomes [@dmelloConfusionCanBe2014; @hascherLearningEmotionPerspectives2010; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016]. Third, research that investigates the existence of social and emotional competences that may be beneficial inside and outside learning contexts, and how to empower learners with those competences [@brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016; @winneWhatStateArt2015].

The role of affective phenomena in general, and emotions more specifically, is particularly challenging in computer-mediated learning environments -- a term used throughout the text to encompass, at least partially, concepts such as advanced learning technologies, computer-based learning environments, computer-supported collaborative learning, distance or remote learning, e-learning, and technology enhanced learning. The role of computational devices in both formal and informal education has become ubiquitous, especially in higher education, and a growing body of research is therefore devoted to investigating the interplay between affective phenomena and computer-mediated learning environments [@arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @dmelloFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017].

On the one hand, part of the literature on the subject highlights shortcomings in computer-mediated learning environments due to the lack of para-verbal cues, usually available in non-mediated face-to-face interactions, which play a prominent role in coordination, communication, and overall meaning-making in learning situations [@marchandRoleEmotionLearning2012; @michinovFacetofaceContactMidpoint2008; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003; @kreijnsSocialAspectsCSCL2013; @dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016]. In fact, even in co-located settings, the presence of a computer captures and directs learners' attention [@eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012], and therefore reduce the availability of cues, such as facial expressions or body postures, that are well known to convey emotional meaning [@banzigerEmotionRecognitionExpressions2009; @martinezContributionsFacialExpressions2016; @schererInvestigatingAppraisaldrivenFacial2019; @shumanEmotionPerceptionComponential2017]. These shortcomings are further accentuated in distance learning, especially in asynchronous settings, where learners do not interact in real time, but have to cope with latency time and delayed exchanges [@bates2005technology; @jacquinotApprivoiserDistanceSupprimer1993a; @paquelinDistanceQuestionsProximites2011]. There is a growing consensus in considering that such situations may benefit from some form of *social presence*, that is, the perception of others in the absence of *physical* presence [@gunawardenaSocialPresencePredictor1997; @jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010; @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017]. In this regard, several contributions highlight the importance of affective phenomena in providing a holistic experience of this social presence [@jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010; @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017; @rourkeLearningCommunitiesInquiry2009; @kirschnerAwarenessCognitiveSocial2015].

On the other hand, the literature also suggests that human beings' need to experience and express emotions transcends time and space [@derksRoleEmotionComputermediated2008; @parkinsonEmotionsDirectRemote2008; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @vankleefSocialEffectsEmotions2017]. In this regard, the use of computers may provide alternatives, or even enhance emotional experience and communication through dedicated or integrated artifacts [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007; @derksRoleEmotionComputermediated2008; @parkinsonEmotionsDirectRemote2008; @vankleefSocialEffectsEmotions2017]. In other words, face-to-face interaction may not necessarily be considered as the golden standard to re-enact, for instance, by providing seamless audio/video connection [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013]. On the contrary, emotion in computer-mediated learning environments may be conveyed through a wide panel of options, ranging from *simple* emoticons to autonomic recognition and representation through dedicated hardware and software [@arguedasModelProvidingEmotion2018; @baralouEmotionsSpatialisationSocial2013; @gliksonDarkSideSmiley2018; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015]. Computational devices open a wide spectrum of possibilities in the cycle of input, processing, and output of emotional information, including various means to gather data, persistence of data over time, visual-spatial displaying of data, as well as technologies that react or adapt the environment based on learners' affective experience [@arguedasModelProvidingEmotion2018; @cerneaGroupAffectiveTone2014; @dmelloFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @grawemeyerAffectiveLearningImproving2017; @kimRoleAffectiveMotivational2012; @leonyProvisionAwarenessLearners2013; @fuentesSystematicLiteratureReview2017; @silvaComparativeStudyUsers2020].

The choice of how to endow the computer-mediated learning environment with affect-related information and the reasons to do so depends on various criteria, with pedagogical and technical aspects often intertwined in mutual influence. In this regard, a growing body of research in the last decade has started to investigate the possibility to endow computer-mediated learning environments with emotional awareness, which is roughly defined as information about one's own emotions and/or about the emotions of other learners sharing the same computer-mediated learning environment [@arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @dmelloFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. Contributions pertaining to this line of inquiry explicitly or implicitly share one ore more of the following underlying assumptions. First, it is posited that learners may benefit from being aware of their own emotions, that is, that their own emotions provide instrumental information for self-regulation of learning [@ez-zaouiaEmodashDashboardSupporting2020; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEMORELOutilReporting2016; @winneWhatStateArt2015]. Second, it is assumed that emotion may convey instrumental information to others, for them to integrate that information into their own learning task, as a means once again to improve co-regulation and social regulation of learning [@eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @winneWhatStateArt2015; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016; @jarvelaEnhancingSociallyShared2015]. Third, it is also implied that emotion can be fruitfully conveyed in a computer-mediated learning environment, that is, the emotional information is made available and processed by users in the learning environment where learning activity and emotional awareness coexist in some form [@bersetVisualisationDonneesRecherche2018; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @leonyProvisionAwarenessLearners2013; @harleyMeasuringEmotionsSurvey2015; @fuentesSystematicLiteratureReview2017].

One way for learning activity and emotional awareness to coexist is through the use of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT). An EAT coalesces features of affect- or emotion-aware systems on the one side, and of awareness tools on the other. Affect- or emotion-aware systems [@calvoFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @grawemeyerAffectiveLearningImproving2017; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017] stem mainly from the interdisciplinary field of affective computing [@picardAffectiveComputing2000; @schererBlueprintAffectiveComputing2010] and are therefore driven, *in primis*, by computational modeling of affective phenomena [@marsellaComputationalModelsEmotion2010; @schererComponentProcessModel2010]. Awareness tools [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013; @janssenGroupAwarenessTools2011], on the other hand, emerged primarily from the field of computer-mediated collaboration and were later implemented in computer-mediated learning environments, especially through the interdisciplinary field of computer-supported collaborative learning [@dillenbourgEvolutionResearchComputersupported2009; @kreijnsSocialAspectsCSCL2013; @millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015; @suthersTechnologyAffordancesIntersubjective2006]. Awareness tools have thus an intrinsic inter-subjective nature, which emphasizes learners' need to build and update a mutual understanding of the situation at hand [@clarkGroundingCommunication1991; @roschelleConstructionSharedKnowledge1995] as a means to maximize meaning-making and, by extension, learning processes and outcomes [@dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013; @janssenGroupAwarenessTools2011; @suthersTechnologyAffordancesIntersubjective2006].

It follows that an EAT is a technological artifact, whose aim is to provide learners with emotional awareness in computer-mediated learning environments, under the assumption that its availability is beneficial to learners at the individual and/or collective levels [@arguedasAnalyzingHowEmotion2016; @avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @feidakisEndowingElearningSystems2011; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. Such a claim has received in the last years an increasing interest in the affective, computer, and learning sciences from different theoretical, technical, methodological and empirical standpoints (*ibid.*). Applications of an EAT in computer-mediated learning environments may in fact range from providing learners with the possibility to self-report their emotions during a distance learning course as a means to increase self-reflection and self-regulation [@lavoueEmotionalDataCollection2017] to the implementation of a multi-modal system that provide emotional awareness through an unobtrusive brain-computer interface during computer-mediated collaboration [@makhkamovaAugmentingCollaborationInvisible2019]. Despite the differences in application, though, research gravitating around an EAT usually aims at investigating which factors -- intrinsic to the tool, deriving from the interaction between learners and the tool, between learners themselves, as well as between learners and the instructional design -- determine the adoption, perception, use and instrumentality of emotional awareness in computer-mediated learning environments.

## Thesis Contribution

The thesis aims at extending this area of investigation by implementing and assessing a multipurpose appraisal-driven emotion awareness tool based on self-report, primarily thought to be adopted in computer-mediated learning environments. The aim of the contribution is therefore twofold. On the one side, the methodological implementation of an EAT with specific features, among which the connection to appraisal theories of emotion [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013; @rosemanAppraisalTheoryOverview2001; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @siemerSameSituationdifferentEmotions2007]. On the other side, the empirical assessment of the adoption, use, perception and instrumentality of the EAT in computer-mediated learning environments as a means both to evaluate and inform -- adopting a cyclical interaction design perspective [@rogersInterctionDesignHumanComputer2011] -- the implementation of the EAT. Both aims are briefly outlined in the remainder of the section.

### Methodolocial Objectives {.unnumbered}

Alongside other scholars [@arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEMORELOutilReporting2016], I reckon that the specific way in which emotional awareness is implemented in a computer-mediated learning environment plays a prominent role in determining whether the EAT is adopted in the first place, and whether it serves its purpose in the wide spectrum of potential applications in which it may be deployed. All things considering, the role of an EAT may be broken down in two intertwined factors:

1.  Whether, when, how, and why emotional information is *inserted* into the computer-mediated learning environments through the EAT, creating thus the necessary -- but not sufficient -- conditions for emotional awareness to emerge. In awareness tools, this function refers to *displaying* information [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @schmidtProblemAwareness2002] and is the equivalent of *expressing* emotion [@darwinExpressionEmotionsMan1872; @scarantinoHowThingsEmotional2017; @vankleefSocialEffectsEmotions2017] when applied to an EAT.
2.  Whether, when, how, and why emotional information is *retrieved* from the EAT and processed by learners, for emotional awareness to be enacted and hopefully contribute to learning processes and outcomes. In awareness tools, this relates to *monitoring* information [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @schmidtProblemAwareness2002], which corresponds to *perceiving* or *recognizing* emotion [@hareliWhatEmotionalReactions2010; @schlegelNomologicalNetworkEmotion2017; @hallSocialPsychologyPerceiving2018] in the context of an EAT.

One of the central claim of the thesis is that both functions may be better served with the interaction of three elements: voluntary self-report of emotion; implementing an emotion structure into the tool; and moment-to-moment availability of emotional awareness in the computer-mediated learning environment. Each element is further developed in chapter X ans is only briefly sketched hereafter.

**Voluntary Self-Report**. I consider the opportunity that learners may best profit from emotional awareness through voluntary expression of their emotions [@fuentesSystematicLiteratureReview2017; @mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015; @ritchieEvolutionSelfreportingMethods2016; @silvaComparativeStudyUsers2020], as opposed to automatic emotion detection [@jordivallverduHandbookResearchSynthesizing2015]. Self-report may encourage students to interpret, reflect on, extrapolate and construe meaning from emotion [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007; @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020] in a more flexible and adaptable process compared to the automatic detection of a predefined *matches* from uni- or multi-modal sources [@calvoAffectDetectionInterdisciplinary2010; @jordivallverduHandbookResearchSynthesizing2015]. 

**Implementing an Emotion Structure into the Tool**. I evaluate the possibility that an EAT may best serve its purpose if its functioning is driven by emotion theories [@sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @sep-emotion]. In this regard, the thesis builds on appraisal theories of emotion [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013; @rosemanAppraisalTheoryOverview2001; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005] to propose a parsimonious computational model bridging the cognitive evaluation of a situation -- responsible, according to appraisal theories, for emotion elicitation and differentiation [@schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985; @siemerSameSituationdifferentEmotions2007] -- with the resulting conscious emotional experience that learners may use for intra-personal and inter-personal emotion meaning-making [@grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008; @schererHumanEmotionExperiences2013]. It is also argued that implementing an emotion structure provides the conditions to link the use of the EAT and emotional competence within the same framework [@schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007; @schlegelGenevaEmotionalCompetence2018].

**Moment-to-Moment Availability of Emotional Awareness**. Finally, I surmise that an EAT may increase its usefulness if learners are allowed to insert and retrieve emotional information at any moment [@graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. This refers to a distinction in instructional design between scripting and awareness tools [@millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015]. With scripting, the learning activity is planned for learners to become aware of relevant information at specific moments [@dillenbourgOverscriptingCSCLRisks2002; @fischerScriptTheoryGuidance2013]. For instance, learners may express or assess their emotions at the end of a task [@eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012]. Conversely, awareness tools bestow learners with the responsibility of *producing and consuming* information at the very moment they see fit, either from an instrumental point of view (this information is important right now), or depending on the possibility to set their mind to it when coordinating multiple actions [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013].

The methodological objectives of the thesis are twofold:

1. Provide detailed information of the design of an EAT where these three factors coalesce. To attend this objective, I build on and extend, both theoretically and technically, previous work that I have conducted as part of the Emotion Awareness Tool for Computer-Mediated Interactions (EATMINT) project [@avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @cereghettiSharingEmotionsComputermediated2015; @Chanel2013; @chanelGrandChallengeProblem2016; @fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015; @fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013].
2. Make abstraction of some fundamental features of the implemented EAT in order to provide a multi-purpose toolbox, which can be adapted to different situations where emotional awareness through the use of an EAT with the aforementioned features is of interest. The toolbox is intended for scholars and practitioners alike, for them to dispose to a ready-to-use EAT, which can be integrated alongside different computer-mediated task and environments. With respect to research more specifically, the toolbox provide scholars with the possibility to adopt different and multi-dimensional affective spaces as the underlying structure of emotion [@fontaineWorldEmotionsNot2007; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @russellCircumplexModelAffect1980; @schererWhatDeterminesFeeling2006] within the same tool. This is also intended to increase comparability of contributions, as well as encouraging sharing of data and material in open formats [@lowndesOurPathBetter2017; @scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @Nosek1422].

### Empirical Objectives {.unnumbered}

In order to evaluate and inform the methodological objectives, the thesis also provides two empirical contributions, whose objectives are divided in two intertwined levels. The *upper*-level, common to both studies, is to provide an overall and comparative assessment of the adoption, use, perception and instrumentality of the implemented EAT in two different computer-mediated learning environments: one adopting a synchronous and collaborative scenario [@avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013], whereas the second uses asynchronous and individual settings [@lavoueEmotionalDataCollection2017; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEMORELOutilReporting2016].

On a *lower*-level, each contribution has specific research questions, which aim at investigating to what extent learners may benefit from the presence of an EAT. The use of empirical researches rather than *pure* usability testing is also driven by the multi-purpose vocation of the tool: both contributions represent in fact ecological scenarios to collect encouraging or critical evidence, upon which the implementation of the tool can be steered.  

**Emotional Awareness in Synchronous and Collaborative Settings**.

**Emotional Awareness in Asynchronous and Individual Settings**.
