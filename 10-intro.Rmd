Imagine that you are co-authoring a text with a colleague for an upcoming assignment that you must submit in a course: you are at home, she can be anywhere in the world. You are using an online text processor, which allows you to edit the document simultaneously. This particular text editor has the feature of attributing animals names to authors, so that you are currently identified in the work-space as *anonymous hippo*, and your partner is *anonymous turtle*. The only thing you can see about the *turtle* is the flow of letters that stems from the position of her cursor in the document whenever she is typing on her keyboard, and *vice versa*. Imagine being in this situation: what kind of information about the *turtle* would you like to know to better assess how the learning task is going? And what kind of information about yourself would you like the *turtle* to know, for her to better assess how the learning task is going?

Now imagine that you are coding a project in an introductory programming course: you are facing lines of condensed and often mysterious syntax, whose execution sometimes results in the desired and celebrated outcome, but oftentimes leads to irking and obscure message errors. You are alone in front of your screen -- riddled with software you barely know and dozens of tabs in your browsers with results to hazardous research queries -- wondering weather your colleagues in the course are facing a similar fate. What information about them would help you better cope with this situation? What information about yourself would you like to share, which could be beneficial both to you and them?

You have certainly guessed from the title of the thesis that the answer put forward to these questions is: *emotions*. In the last few decades, emotions have been widely studied from different perspectives and with different methods, giving rise to the interdisciplinary field of affective sciences [e.g., @davidsonHandbookAffectiveSciences2003; @sanderOxfordCompanionEmotion2009]. A consistent body of research has corroborated the importance that affective phenomena -- such as emotions, feelings, motivations, moods, or preferences -- play in various circumstances of life, both individually and collectively, and at different levels of processing [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @armonyCambridgeHandbookHuman2013; @barrettHowEmotionsAre2018; @colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014; @damasioStrangeOrderThings2018; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016; @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013;  @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018]. As a consequence of that, leading scholars in the field [@dukesRiseAffectivism2021] have recently considered legitimate to ask whether research has entered a new era -- the era of  *affectivism* :

> The conceptual, methodological, and technical advances made within the last few decades have demonstrated that affective processes are unquestionably enlightening when it comes to understanding both behaviour and cognition. While it will ultimately be the responsibility of historians of science to determine whether or not a new era has begun, given the undeniable impact of affective sciences on our models of brain, mind, and behaviour, it seems relevant to ask today whether we are now in the era of affectivism. -- @dukesRiseAffectivism2021, p. 819

Research in learning psychology and education sciences more broadly have also been concerned with the central role of *affectivism*, even though the subject has been neglected in the past, reckoning that affective phenomena play a pivotal role for teachers and learners alike [@bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018]. At first blush, three intertwined research areas can be discerned. First, research investigating the effect of learning and teaching activities on learners' and teachers' affective experience [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013; @pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014]. Second, research that, conversely, focuses on the effect of affective phenomena on learning processes and outcomes [@dmelloConfusionCanBe2014; @hascherLearningEmotionPerspectives2010; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016]. Third, research that investigates the existence of social and emotional competences that may be beneficial inside and outside learning contexts, and how to empower learners with those competences [@brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016; @winneWhatStateArt2015].

In computer-mediated learning environments -- a term used throughout the text to encompass, at least partially, concepts such as advanced learning technologies, computer-based learning environments, computer-supported collaborative learning, distance or remote learning, e-learning, and technology enhanced learning -- the role of affective phenomena, and emotions more specifically, is particularly challenging. On the one hand, literature highlights shortcomings due to the lack of para-verbal cues available in face-to-face interactions not mediated by computers, which play a prominent role in coordination, communication, and overall meaning-making in learning situations [@marchandRoleEmotionLearning2012; @michinovFacetofaceContactMidpoint2008; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003; @kreijnsSocialAspectsCSCL2013; @dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016]. In fact, even in co-located situations, the presence of a computer captures and directs learners' attention on the screen [@eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012], and therefore reduce the availability of cues, such as facial expressions or body postures, that are well known to convey emotional meaning [@banzigerEmotionRecognitionExpressions2009; @martinezContributionsFacialExpressions2016; @schererInvestigatingAppraisaldrivenFacial2019; @shumanEmotionPerceptionComponential2017]. These shortcomings are further accentuated in remote learning situations, especially in asynchronous settings, where learners do not interact in real time, but have to cope with latency time and delayed exchanges [@bates2005technology; @jacquinotApprivoiserDistanceSupprimer1993a; @paquelinDistanceQuestionsProximites2011]. There is a growing consensus in considering that such situations may benefit from some form of *social presence*, that is, the perception of others in the absence of *physical* presence [@gunawardenaSocialPresencePredictor1997; @jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010; @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017]. Current trends on the subject consistently highlight the importance of affective phenomena in providing a holistic experience of this social presence [@jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010; @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017; @rourkeLearningCommunitiesInquiry2009; @kirschnerAwarenessCognitiveSocial2015]. 

On the other hand, the literature also suggests that human beings' need to experience and express emotions transcends time and space [@derksRoleEmotionComputermediated2008; @parkinsonEmotionsDirectRemote2008; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @vankleefSocialEffectsEmotions2017]. The use of computers can provide alternatives, or even enhance emotional experience and communication [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007; @derksRoleEmotionComputermediated2008; @parkinsonEmotionsDirectRemote2008; @vankleefSocialEffectsEmotions2017]. In other words, face-to-face interaction may not necessarily be considered as the golden standard to re-enact, for instance, by providing seamless audio/video connection [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013]. On the contrary, emotion in computer-mediated learning environments can be conveyed through a wide panel of options, ranging from *simple* emoticons to autonomic recognition and representation through dedicated hardware and software [@arguedasModelProvidingEmotion2018; @baralouEmotionsSpatialisationSocial2013; @gliksonDarkSideSmiley2018; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015]. The choice of how to endow the computer-mediated learning environment with affect-related information and the reasons to do so depend upon various criteria, with pedagogical and technical aspects often intertwined in mutual influence. 

In this regard, a growing body of research in the last decade has started to investigate the possibility to endow computer-mediated learning environments with emotional awareness, which is roughly defined as information about one's own emotions and/or about the emotions of other learners sharing the same computer-mediated learning environment [@arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @dmelloFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. Contributions pertaining to this line of inquiry explicitly or implicitly share one ore more of the following underlying assumptions. First, it is posited that learners may benefit of being aware of their own emotions, that is, that their own emotions provide information that may be instrumental to their learning processes and outcomes [@ez-zaouiaEmodashDashboardSupporting2020; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEMORELOutilReporting2016]. Second, it is assumed that emotion may convey instrumental information to others, for them to integrate that information into their own learning task, as a means once again to improve learning processes and outcomes, individually or collectively [@avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. Third, it is also implied that emotion can be fruitfully conveyed in a computer-mediated learning environment, that is, the emotional information is made available and processed by users in the learning environment where learning activity and emotional awareness coexists in some form [@bersetVisualisationDonneesRecherche2018; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @leonyProvisionAwarenessLearners2013].

One way for learning activity and emotional awareness to coexist is through the use of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT). An EAT coalesces features of affect- or emotion-aware systems on the one side, and of awareness tools on the other. Affect- or emotion-aware systems [@calvoFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @grawemeyerAffectiveLearningImproving2017; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017] stem mainly from the interdisciplinary field of affective computing [@picardAffectiveComputing2000; @schererBlueprintAffectiveComputing2010], and are therefore driven, *in primis*, by computational modeling of affective phenomena [@marsellaComputationalModelsEmotion2010; @schererComponentProcessModel2010]. Awareness tools [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013; @janssenGroupAwarenessTools2011], on the other hand, emerged primarily from the field of computer-mediated collaboration and were later implemented in computer-mediated learning environments, especially through another interdisciplinary field: Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning [@dillenbourgEvolutionResearchComputersupported2009; @kreijnsSocialAspectsCSCL2013; @millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015; @suthersTechnologyAffordancesIntersubjective2006]. Awareness tools are mainly concerned with the need for learners' to share a mutual understanding of the situation at hand as a means to maximize meaning-making, and by extension learning processes and outcomes [@dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013; @janssenGroupAwarenessTools2011; @suthersTechnologyAffordancesIntersubjective2006]. 

It follows that an EAT is a technological artifact, whose aim is to provide learners with emotional awareness in computer-mediated learning environments, under the assumption that its availability is beneficial to learners at the individual and/or collective levels [@arguedasAnalyzingHowEmotion2016; @avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @feidakisEndowingElearningSystems2011; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. Such a claim has received in the last year an increasing interest both from a technical, methodological and empirical standpoint (*ibid.*). In fact, the usefulness of an EAT depends, among other things, at least from the following factors: (1) whether, how and when emotional awareness is created; and (2) whether, how and when emotional awareness is taken into account during the learning task at hand. 

## Thesis Contribution {-}

The present contribution builds on and extends previous work on emotional awareness and Emotion Awareness Tools more specifically, particularly from the Emotion Awareness Tool for Computer-Mediated Interactions (EATMINT) project [@avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @cereghettiSharingEmotionsComputermediated2015; @Chanel2013; @chanelGrandChallengeProblem2016; @fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015; @fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. The project, which was part of the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) *Affective Sciences*, had two intertwined objectives:

1. Designing Emotion Awareness Tools, which allow either the explicit or the autonomic sharing of 
emotions in computer-mediated interaction; 
2. Studying the impact of emotional awareness on collaboration both at intra- and inter-personal 
levels, with respect to the emergence of strategies that improve collaboration such as monitoring, 
regulating and reflecting on emotions.

The thesis's contribution is twofold. On the one hand, from a methodological standpoint, it extends previous work on the design and development of an EAT, named the Dynamic Emotion Wheel [@fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015; @fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015]. On the other hand, from an empirical standpoint, it assess the adoption, use, and perception of that EAT in computer-mediated learning environments. Both objectives are further developed in the remainder of the section.
