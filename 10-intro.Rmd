General introduction to the thesis:

* Importance of affective phenomena in learning (affectivism era?)
* Affective phenomena in computer-mediated learning environments: 
  * face-to-face vs. remote interaction
  * ICT can contribute to go beyond the face-to-face golden standard
* Current trends in endowing computer-mediated learning environments with affect-aware or emotion-aware technologies
* Spin-off of the EATMINT project 

Methodological objectives:

* Taking advantage of emotion structure implemented into the tool to provide self- and group- emotional awareness
* Implementation of a parsimonious computational model using multidimensional affective spaces to connect appraisals and subjective feelings
* Building a toolbox around the model to foster open science principles

Empirical objectives:

* Overall and comparative assessment of the use, adoption and perception of the EAT in two different computer-mediated learning environments: synchronous and collaborative (CSCL) vs. asynchronous and individual (*mainstream* distance/e-learning)
* Specific research questions:
  * In CSCL: contribute to assess what is interesting about emotional awareness (self-report, emotion in others, or both?)
  * In distance learning: emotion as a way to convey social presence from a longitudinal perspective
