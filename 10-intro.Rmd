Imagine that you are co-authoring a text with a colleague for an upcoming assignment that you must submit in a course: you are at home, she can be anywhere in the world. You are using an online text processor, which allows you to edit the document simultaneously. This particular text editor has the feature of attributing animals names to authors, so that you are currently identified in the work-space as *anonymous hippo*, and your partner is *anonymous turtle*. The only thing you can see about the *turtle* is the flow of letters that stems from the position of her cursor in the document whenever she is typing on her keyboard, and *vice versa*. Imagine being in this situation: what kind of information about the *turtle* would you like to know to better assess how the learning task is going? And what kind of information about yourself would you like the *turtle* to know, for her to better assess how the learning task is going?

Now imagine that you are coding a project in an introductory programming course: you are facing lines of condensed and often mysterious syntax, whose execution sometimes results in the desired and celebrated outcome, but oftentimes leads to irking and obscure message errors. You are alone in front of your screen -- riddled with software you barely know and dozens of tabs in your browsers with results to hazardous research queries -- wondering weather your colleagues in the course are facing a similar fate. What information about them would help you better cope with this situation? What information about yourself would you like to share, which could be beneficial both to you and them?

You have certainly guessed from the title of the thesis that the answer put forward to these questions is: *emotions*. In the last few decades, emotions have been widely studied from different perspectives and with different methods, giving rise to the interdisciplinary field of affective sciences [e.g., @davidsonHandbookAffectiveSciences2003; @sanderOxfordCompanionEmotion2009]. A consistent body of research has nowadays corroborated the importance that affective phenomena play in various circumstances of life, both individually and collectively, and at different levels of processing [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @armonyCambridgeHandbookHuman2013; @barrettHowEmotionsAre2018; @colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014; @damasioStrangeOrderThings2018; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016; @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013;  @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018]. As a consequence of that, leading scholars in the field [@dukesRiseAffectivism2021] have recently considered legitimate to ask whether research has entered a new era -- the era of  *affectivism* :

> The conceptual, methodological, and technical advances made within the last few decades have demonstrated that affective processes are unquestionably enlightening when it comes to understanding both behaviour and cognition. While it will ultimately be the responsibility of historians of science to determine whether or not a new era has begun, given the undeniable impact of affective sciences on our models of brain, mind, and behaviour, it seems relevant to ask today whether we are now in the era of affectivism. -- @dukesRiseAffectivism2021, p. 819

Research in learning psychology and education sciences more broadly have also been concerned with the central role of *affectivism*, reckoning that affective phenomena play a pivotal role for teachers and learners alike [@bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018]. At first blush, three intertwined research areas can be discerned. First, research investigating the effect of learning and teaching activities on learners' and teachers' affective experience [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013; @pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014; @reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018]. Second, research that, conversely, focuses on the effect of affective phenomena on learning processes and outcomes [@dmelloConfusionCanBe2014; @hascherLearningEmotionPerspectives2010; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016]. Third, research that investigates the existence of social and emotional competences that may be beneficial inside and outside learning contexts, and how to empower learners with those competences [@brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016; @winneWhatStateArt2015]. 

General introduction to the thesis:

* Importance of affective phenomena in learning (affectivism era?)
* Affective phenomena in computer-mediated learning environments: 
  * face-to-face vs. remote interaction
  * ICT can contribute to go beyond the face-to-face golden standard
* Current trends in endowing computer-mediated learning environments with affect-aware or emotion-aware technologies
* Spin-off of the EATMINT project 

Methodological objectives:

* Taking advantage of emotion structure implemented into the tool to provide self- and group- emotional awareness
* Implementation of a parsimonious computational model using multidimensional affective spaces to connect appraisals and subjective feelings
* Building a toolbox around the model to foster open science principles

Empirical objectives:

* Overall and comparative assessment of the use, adoption and perception of the EAT in two different computer-mediated learning environments: synchronous and collaborative (CSCL) vs. asynchronous and individual (*mainstream* distance/e-learning)
* Specific research questions:
  * In CSCL: contribute to assess what is interesting about emotional awareness (self-report, emotion in others, or both?)
  * In distance learning: emotion as a way to convey social presence from a longitudinal perspective
