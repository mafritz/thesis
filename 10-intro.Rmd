Imagine that you are co-authoring a text with a colleague for an upcoming assignment that you must submit in a course: you are at home, she can be anywhere in the world. You are using an online text processor, which allows you to edit the document simultaneously. This particular text editor has the feature of attributing animals names to authors, so that you are currently identified in the work-space as *anonymous hippo*, and your partner is *anonymous turtle*. The only thing you can see about the *turtle* is the flow of letters that stems from the position of her cursor in the document whenever she is typing on her keyboard, and *vice versa*. Imagine being in this situation: what kind of information about the *turtle* would you like to know to better assess how the learning task is going? And what kind of information about yourself would you like the *turtle* to know, for her to better assess how the learning task is going?

Now imagine that you are coding a project in an introductory programming course: you are facing lines of condensed and often mysterious syntax, whose execution sometimes results in the desired and celebrated outcome, but oftentimes leads to irking and obscure message errors. You are alone in front of your screen -- riddled with software you barely know and dozens of tabs in your browsers with results to hazardous research queries -- wondering weather your colleagues in the course are facing a similar fate. What information about them would help you better cope with this situation? What information about yourself would you like to share, which could be beneficial both to you and them?

You have certainly guessed from the title of the thesis that the answer put forward to these questions is: *emotions*. In the last few decades, emotions have been widely studied from different perspectives and with different methods, giving rise to the interdisciplinary field of affective sciences [e.g., @davidsonHandbookAffectiveSciences2003; @sanderOxfordCompanionEmotion2009]. A consistent body of research has nowadays corroborated the importance that affective phenomena play in various circumstances of life, both individually and collectively, and at different levels of processing [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @armonyCambridgeHandbookHuman2013; @barrettHowEmotionsAre2018; @colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014; @damasioStrangeOrderThings2018; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016; @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013;  @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018]. As a consequence of that, leading scholars in the field [@dukesRiseAffectivism2021] have recently considered legitimate to ask whether research has entered a new era -- the era of  *affectivism* :

> The conceptual, methodological, and technical advances made within the last few decades have demonstrated that affective processes are unquestionably enlightening when it comes to understanding both behaviour and cognition. While it will ultimately be the responsibility of historians of science to determine whether or not a new era has begun, given the undeniable impact of affective sciences on our models of brain, mind, and behaviour, it seems relevant to ask today whether we are now in the era of affectivism. -- @dukesRiseAffectivism2021, p. 819

Research in learning psychology and education sciences more broadly have also been concerned with the central role of *affectivism*, reckoning that affective phenomena play a pivotal role for teachers and learners alike [@bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018]. At first blush, three intertwined research areas can be discerned. First, research investigating the effect of learning and teaching activities on learners' and teachers' affective experience [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013; @pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014; @reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018]. Second, research that, conversely, focuses on the effect of affective phenomena on learning processes and outcomes [@dmelloConfusionCanBe2014; @hascherLearningEmotionPerspectives2010; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016]. Third, research that investigates the existence of social and emotional competences that may be beneficial inside and outside learning contexts, and how to empower learners with those competences [@brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016; @winneWhatStateArt2015]. 

The thesis focuses on particular learning situations, which adopt computer-mediated learning environments as an integral part of the learning design. The use of computational devices in education has become ubiquitous both in formal -- at various levels of education -- and informal situations, and therefore the field encompasses a broad range of pedagogical and technical principles. In the thesis, though, computer-mediated learning environments are considered more as a *situational* rather than a pedagogical factor. In other words, the focus is mainly on how emotion can *happen* in computer-mediated learning environments, regardless of the pedagogical reasons behind the adoption of such a learning environment. As a consequence, the term computer-mediated learning environment as intended in the contribution encompasses, at least partially, similar -- but not equivalent -- concepts such as Technology Enhanced Learning, remote or distance learning, e-learning, Computer-Based Learning Environments, and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. On the other hand, it does not include what are often referred to as Advanced Learning Technologies, that is, learning environments that implement some form of *artificial intelligence*, for instance in recognizing, reacting or adapting to learner's behavior. This is a major tenet of the thesis and will be developed more thoroughly later in the text. 

In computer-mediated learning environments, the role of affective phenomena in general, and emotions in particular, is somehow ambivalent. On the one hand, literature highlights shortcomings due to the lack of para-verbal cues that are usually available in non-mediated situations, such as face-to-face interactions without the presence of a computer [@marchandRoleEmotionLearning2012; @michinovFacetofaceContactMidpoint2008; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003; @kreijnsSocialAspectsCSCL2013]. In fact, even in co-located situations, the presence of a computer captures and directs learners' attention on the screen [@eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012], and therefore reduce the availability of cues, such as facial expressions or body posture, that are well known to convey emotional meaning [@banzigerEmotionRecognitionExpressions2009; @martinezContributionsFacialExpressions2016; @schererInvestigatingAppraisaldrivenFacial2019; @shumanEmotionPerceptionComponential2017]. These shortcomings are further accentuated in remote learning situations, especially in asynchronous settings, that is, when learners do not interact in real time, but have to cope with latency time and delayed interaction [@bates2005technology; @jacquinotApprivoiserDistanceSupprimer1993a; @paquelinDistanceQuestionsProximites2011]. There is a growing consensus in considering that such situations may benefit from some form of *social presence*, that is, the perception of others in the absence of *physical* presence [@gunawardenaSocialPresencePredictor1997; @jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010; @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017]. Current trends on the subject consistently highlight the importance of affective phenomena in providing a holistic experience of this social presence [@jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010; @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017; @rourkeLearningCommunitiesInquiry2009; @kirschnerAwarenessCognitiveSocial2015]. 

On the other hand, the literature also suggests that human beings' need to experience and express emotions transcends time and space, and in that, the use of computers can provide alternatives, or even enhance emotional experience and communication [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007; @derksRoleEmotionComputermediated2008; @parkinsonEmotionsDirectRemote2008; @vankleefSocialEffectsEmotions2017]. In other words, face-to-face interaction may not necessarily be considered as the golden standard to re-enact, for instance, by providing seamless audio/video connection [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013]. On the contrary, emotion in computer-mediated learning environments can be conveyed through a wide panel of options, ranging from *simple* emoticons to autonomic recognition and representation through dedicated hardware and software [@arguedasModelProvidingEmotion2018; @baralouEmotionsSpatialisationSocial2013; @gliksonDarkSideSmiley2018; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017]. The choice of how to endow the computer-mediated learning environment with affect-related information and the reasons to do so depend upon various criteria, with pedagogical and technical aspects often intertwined by mutual influence. 

Congruently with A growing body of research in the last decade has started to investigate whether endowing computer-mediated learning environments with the possibility to experience, express, and communicate learners' affective phenomena could be beneficial to learning processes and outcomes. 



General introduction to the thesis:

* Importance of affective phenomena in learning (affectivism era?)
* Affective phenomena in computer-mediated learning environments: 
  * face-to-face vs. remote interaction
  * ICT can contribute to go beyond the face-to-face golden standard
* Current trends in endowing computer-mediated learning environments with affect-aware or emotion-aware technologies
* Spin-off of the EATMINT project 

Methodological objectives:

* Taking advantage of emotion structure implemented into the tool to provide self- and group- emotional awareness
* Implementation of a parsimonious computational model using multidimensional affective spaces to connect appraisals and subjective feelings
* Building a toolbox around the model to foster open science principles

Empirical objectives:

* Overall and comparative assessment of the use, adoption and perception of the EAT in two different computer-mediated learning environments: synchronous and collaborative (CSCL) vs. asynchronous and individual (*mainstream* distance/e-learning)
* Specific research questions:
  * In CSCL: contribute to assess what is interesting about emotional awareness (self-report, emotion in others, or both?)
  * In distance learning: emotion as a way to convey social presence from a longitudinal perspective
