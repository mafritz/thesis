This chapter provides an overview of the extant literature, combining different sources of scientific knowledge, which corroborate the interest for endowing distance learning settings with emotional awareness. The overall perspective adopted in the chapter is therefore rather inductive, with a collection of theories and empirical evidence that support the pertinence of emotional awareness. A *bona fide*, uncritical approach to the extant literature is warranted by two intertwined reasons. First, there is consensus among different scholars about the fact that the scientific study of emotion in learning -- and distance learning more specifically -- is a recent line of inquiry [@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018]. At such an early stage, a *loosening*, rather than a *tightening* approach can therefore help cross-fertilization and discover elements of interest [@fiedlerCycleTheoryFormation2004]^[This is limited, though, to the scientific inquiry, whereas in an applied context, caution should be taken not to *play with people's feelings*]. Second, considering the dependency of emotional awareness from technology in the context of distance learning, it remains to be determined whether emotional awareness can lead to theory formation, in the sense of a causal network of risky predictions about phenomena of interest, or it has *only* the potential to intervene as a technological support, regardless of its  explanatory power [@meehlAppraisingAmendingTheories1990]. In other words, if it were to be found that endowing distance learning with emotional awareness results in beneficial effects for learners, it may be *deployed* as-if, waiting for theoretical explanations to *tighten* its causal effects at a later stage [@fiedlerCycleTheoryFormation2004; @meehlAppraisingAmendingTheories1990; @scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020]. 

The chapters starts with an organized, but essential, overview of current trends in learning psychology and education sciences, which consider the interplay between emotion and learning as a crucial interaction to foster learning processes and outcomes. Second, it illustrates how the rationale behind the instrumentality of emotional awareness in distance learning settings emerges from the convergence of multiple disciplines and perspectives, comprising -- but not limited to -- psychological theories about the pivotal role emotion play at the intra- and inter-personal levels; trends in computer-mediated communication and collaboration to implement awareness tools in technology enhanced environments; and current perspectives in the field of affective computing, which aims at empowering learning environments with affect- and emotion-aware systems. The last part of the chapter points out some methodological challenges in the scientific inquiry of emotional awareness, which are meant to pave the way for the second chapter of the theoretical part of the thesis.

There is a growing consensus in the broader education research, including education psychology, in considering learning as the results of cognitive, social, and affective interactions [@bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003; @naykkiSocioemotionalConflictCollaborative2014; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005]. The interplay between two complex and multifaceted concepts as *emotion* and *learning* inevitably leads, exponentially, to further complexity. Both emotion and learning, in fact, *happen* at overlapping and interacting levels, ranging from the *micro-level* of neurophysiological substrates of the brain to the *macro-level* of instructional designs and education systems that take into account -- or otherwise ignore -- learners' emotions. A thorough overview of the multitude of scenarios in which emotion and learning can interact is far beyond the scope of this contribution [for recent and overarching perspectives see for instance @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014].

### Intra-Personal Functions of Emotion

### The Emotion As Social Information Theoretical Framework

### Inter-Personal Functions of Emotion

#### Social Functions of Emotion

The social and cultural function of emotion may therefore have been built upon a *feature* that has evolved particularly in some species, such as human beings, for which inter-personal relations are pivotal to survival and, less dramatically, well-being [@parkinsonEmotionSocialRelations2005; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999]. Keltner and Haidt [-@keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999] identify four level of analysis in which emotion play a social function: (1) the individual level, whenever the source of the emotion is of a social nature -- which, for some scholars, means most if not all of the time [@fischerWhereHaveAll2010; @parkinsonEmotionsAreSocial1996; @rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009]; (2) the dyadic level, such as in direct dialogue or collaboration; (3) the group-level, in which people share a common identities and goals to attain; and (4) the cultural level, where the analysis focus on macro-elements such as history and tradition. A recent overarching synthesis on the social function of emotions across all levels proposed by Fischer and Manstead [-@fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016] identifies two complementary, but distinct, functions performed by emotions: affiliation, and distancing. The affiliation function serves to form and maintain positive social relationship with others, whereas the distancing function helps in establishing and maintaining a social position relative to others. Other social functions of emotions, further developed below in the chapter, comprise the spontaneous tendency of people to share their emotions with others [@rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005], the use of emotional information to better understand behavior and appropriate conduct in social situations [@parkinsonEmotionsInterpersonalInteractions2010; @vankleefHowEmotionsRegulate2009], or situation in which people voluntary attempt to act upon emotions in others [@netzerInterpersonalInstrumentalEmotion2015; @reeckSocialRegulationEmotion2016; @zakiInterpersonalEmotionRegulation2013].
