This chapter provides an overview of the literature, combining different disciplines and perspectives, which corroborates the interest for endowing computer-mediated learning environments with affective phenomena. The chapters starts with an organized overview of current trends in learning psychology and education sciences, which consider the interplay between affect and learning as a crucial interaction to foster learning processes and outcomes. Then, the chapter focuses on affect-aware systems and awareness tools respectively, for an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) shares similarities with both systems. The two systems, though, are driven mainly by different perspectives: affective computing in the first case, and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning in the second. The emergence of an EAT with the characteristics stated in the introduction can therefore be compared and contrasted with the different perspectives provided in the literature.

## Affect and Learning {#affect-and-learning}

The interplay between affect and learning is being investigated at various level of granularity, from the micro-level of neuroscience [*e.g.*, @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016] to the macro-level of how education curricula and institution should reform their programs in order to take affective experiences into account [*e.g.*, @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019]. Rather than a layered analysis, though, this section proposes a selection of contributions -- privileging research related to learning with technology whenever possible -- organized in three categories, which are nevertheless not meant to be neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive: (1) research that focuses *primarily* on the effects of learning processes and outcomes on affect; (2) research that focuses *primarily* on the effects of affect on learning processes and outcomes; and (3) research that focuses *primarily* on how either or both directional effects can be mediated or moderated by various forms of socio-affective competences such as emotional intelligence, emotional competence, and intrinsic or extrinsic emotion regulation. The main aim of the section is to depict an overall and growing cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary interest in considering learning as the results of cognitive, social, and affective interactions, and how emotional awareness through the use of an EAT relates to these research areas.

### The Effects of Learning on Affect {#learning-on-affect}

Research investigating the effect of learning on affective phenomena is primarily concerned in determining what affective reactions are elicited by learning processes and situations, and what are the reasons and mechanisms that concur in eliciting such reactions. According to Pekrun [-@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; -@pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005], for instance, the scientific study of emotion in education emerged in the last few decades by extension of previous work that was primarily focused on reducing anxiety during test exams. In an effort to broaden the perspective on the interplay between emotion and learning, Pekrun set forth an overarching theory, named the *Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions* [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006], which accounts for eliciting mechanisms and consequences of learning situations where some form of achievement is at stake (*e.g.*, passing an exam). The theory states that learners evaluate their learning experience according to two criteria: the subjective control that learners feel over the learning process, and the intrinsic value that they confer to the achievement outcome. Different emotions, such as *frustration*, *enjoyment*, or *boredom*, are then elicited based on the specific evaluation that learners make about the situation, combined with the temporal dimension of the evaluation, that is, whether it is retrospective, perspective, or ongoing. The Control-Value theory is depicted more thoroughly in Chapter \@ref(defining-emotion-unit), but is presented here as a line of inquiry that aims at explaining how and why certain emotions are elicited by learning processes. In this regard, it is also worth mentioning that achievement emotions are only one possible *kind* of emotion that may be elicited in learning. Pekrun and Linnenbrink-Garcia [-@pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014] proposes a taxonomy articulated around four *families* of emotions related to learning and educational settings:

1.  *Achievement emotions*, already mentioned, elicited by activities or outcomes that refer to standards of evaluation. Examples of achievement emotions are *pride* or *shame* that may occur depending on the result of an exam.
2.  *Epistemic emotions*, elicited by processes that learners enact to assimilate and accommodate new information in the intent to build knowledge. Examples of epistemic emotions are *curiosity* or *surprise* emerging from incoming information that may contradict pre-existing knowledge;
3.  *Topic emotions*, elicited directly by the content of the learning activity, independently of achievement or epistemic processes. Examples of topic emotions are *empathy* towards the fate of a character in a novel, or strong affective reactions that may arise from historical or political events;
4.  *Social emotions*, elicited by inter-personal dynamics that are pervasive in learning and educational contexts, such as the relationship with colleagues or teachers. Examples of social emotions are *admiration* for a colleague, who was of help in solving a problem, or *anger* towards a free-rider in a group assignment.

One important element to retain from this taxonomy is that the same *discrete* emotion may pertain to different *families* according to what is the object focus of the eliciting situation [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014]. For instance, *frustration* may be triggered by the result of an exam (achievement), by the self-oriented perception of inability to understand information (epistemic), by the unwillingness to manipulate scientific equipment in a science class (topic), or by the difficulty in explaining to others one's opinion (social).

Another research approach pertaining to the effects of learning on affective phenomena consists in focusing on the kind and frequency of specific affective phenomena emerging from learning experiences, which is in itself valuable knowledge both for instructional designers and researchers, without necessarily proposing an eliciting mechanism. D'Mello [-@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013], for instance, conducted a selective meta-analysis on affective states experienced during individual learning with technology. Combining 24 studies from 5 different countries and from different level of formal education (from middle school to adult students), the author computed the relative frequency of different affective states recorded from different sources, from self-report to retrospective video analysis by trained judges. Results show that only one affective state, defined as *engagement/flow*, was consistently frequent in most of the studies. More *traditional* affective reactions such as *anger*, *anxiety*, *boredom*, *fear*, *frustration*, *happiness*, *sadness* and *surprise* were either infrequent, or subject to great heterogeneity between studies.

Reis and colleagues [-@reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018], on the other hand, performed a similar meta-analysis, but encompassing affective states during Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) [@dillenbourgEvolutionResearchComputersupported2009; @stahlComputersupportedCollaborativeLearning2006; @suthersTechnologyAffordancesIntersubjective2006]. Contrary to D'Mello's contribution (*ibid*), this second meta-analyses integrates also a collective, human-to-human interaction perspective. Starting from an initial corpus of over one thousand contributions between published articles and conference papers, the authors extracted 58 papers. From these, they then computed the number of papers citing different discrete affective states, belonging to different categories of affective phenomena: personality traits, emotions, moods, and socio-emotional factors. With respect to affective states identified as emotion, the authors tallied 29 discrete emotions that appeared in a minimum of two and a maximum of eight papers. The most frequently cited discrete emotions appearing 4 times or more are: *angry*, *confused*, *disgust*, *pride*, and *tired* (in four papers); *curious*, *excited*, *interested*, *joy*, *sadness* and *surprise* (in five papers); *anxious*, *bored*, *relaxed* and *anger* (in six papers); *fear* (in seven papers); and *frustration* (in eight papers).

This brief selection of contributions corroborates the fact that learning does indeed elicit affective phenomena, but that those phenomena varies greatly depending on a number of situated factors. Research is therefore implicated in determining the mechanisms of elicitation, as well as explaining the potential causes of variance in affective experiences according to different learning contexts. In this regard, an EAT may be deployed in different learning contexts, for instance in individual vs. collaborative settings, and gather information about eliciting conditions and learners' affective experience.

### The Effects of Affect on Learning {#affect-on-learning}

Another line of inquiry, which is highly intertwined with the one illustrated in the previous subsection, aims at investigating whether affect in general, and specific affective states more specifically, have effects on learning. One common line of inquiry concerns the identification of emotions that may foster or hinder learning processes or outcomes [@harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @pekrunPositiveEmotionsEducation2002; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @dmelloConfusionCanBe2014]. Research in this area may vary greatly depending on the level of analysis and the affective phenomena they target.

With respect to the level of analysis, it may concern the interplay between affective and cognitive processes such as attention, perception, memory and decision making, which are deeply implicated in learning processes and outcomes [@broschImpactEmotionPerception2013; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013]. Research may target more complex and compounded information processing phenomena, such as creativity or problem-solving [@avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @davisUnderstandingRelationshipMood2009]. But also more inter-personally oriented processes, in which affective phenomena may regulate or undermine collaborative situations [@andriessenSociocognitiveTensionCollaborative2011; @jarvenojaRegulationEmotionsSocially2013; @bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013], as in the case of emotional contagion [@barsadeRippleEffectsEmotional2002; @parkinsonInterpersonalEmotionTransfer2011].

Concerning the kind and nature of affective phenomena, research often adopts a dichotomy between *positive* and *negative* affective phenomena [@shiotaWhatArePositive2021; @pekrunPositiveEmotionsEducation2002; @hascherLearningEmotionPerspectives2010; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @roweUnderstandingRoleNegative2018; @ruizSupportingLearningConsidering2016]. For instance, @ruizSupportingLearningConsidering2016 propose the Twelve Emotions in Academia Model (TEAM), which is meant to foster individual introspection of emotion by providing learners with a self-report tool. The tool comprises 12 discrete emotions equally divided in *positive* and *negative* emotions. The *positive* emotions are *enjoyment*, *hope*, *pride*, *confidence*, *excitement*, and *interest*. The *negative* emotions are *anxiety*, *anger*, *shame*, *hopelessness*, *boredom*, and *frustration*.

This sort of dichotomous categorization, even though intuitive at first, is nevertheless problematic at a closer look. Shiota, Sauter and Desmet [-@shiotaWhatArePositive2021], for instance, identify three different ways in which the polarity of an affective phenomena is conceptualized in the literature:

1.  the valence of subjective feelings, which usually refer to an assessment of the situation as pleasant or unpleasant, even though the concept of valence is in itself multifaceted [@colombettiAppraisingValence2009; @shumanLevelsValence2013];
2.  the direction of motivation, which broadly relates to the tendency of approaching or avoiding a given situation;
3.  the desirability or goal-conduciveness of an emotion-eliciting situation, which focuses on the interplay between the situation and what the person is aiming to achieve.

The polarity of an affective phenomenon may therefore change greatly depending on the adopted perspective. For instance, D'Mello and colleagues [@dmelloConfusionCanBe2014] induced confusion in participants by providing, through a virtual agent in a learning environment, contradictory and incorrect information about the topic at hand. The authors found empirical evidence suggesting that if appropriately induced, regulated and resolved, confusion may be beneficial to learning. Is therefore *confusion* positive or negative? If we consider the first criteria proposed by Shiota and colleagues (*ibid*), confusion is usually considered unpleasant, and therefore negative on valence. The situation is nevertheless less clear for the two other criteria: confusion may be considered *approachable* in situations such as enigmas, and even goal-conducive in situations where the initial confusion evolves in understanding, as in the case of D'Mello and colleagues (*ibid*.).

Rowe and Fitness [-@roweUnderstandingRoleNegative2018] conducted a qualitative study on *negative* emotions in university's teachers and students, and also found mixing results. According to their analysis, negative emotions promote learning by inciting learners to seek assistance; enhancing cognition; increasing motivational drive; and enhancing productivity or performance. On the other hand, negative emotions inhibits learning by hindering communication; preventing engagement and reducing motivation; impairing cognition; and diminishing productivity or performance.

The overall picture that emerges is necessarily scattered and sometimes contradicting. Affect and learning are two extremely complex phenomena and the combination of the two leads, exponentially, to further complexity. Considering a *simple* directional effect between intrinsic *positive* emotion and *positive* learning outcomes, and conversely between intrinsic *negative* emotion and *negative* learning outcomes, is therefore diminishing of both learning and affect [@hascherLearningEmotionPerspectives2010; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014]. As summarized by Pekrun and Perry [-@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2014, p. 134] "with few exceptions, any emotion can prove to be either adaptive or maladaptive". A similar view is taken by Hascher [-@hascherLearningEmotionPerspectives2010]:

> It is too simple to suppose that negative emotions have negative effects on learning, and positive emotions have positive effects. What arguments can be found to clarify a statement like 'Happiness during learning is negative for the learning process'? The question of negative effects of positive emotions (and of positive effects of negative emotions) is very interesting, because it goes beyond plausibility arguments.\
> --- @hascherLearningEmotionPerspectives2010, p. 15

In this regard, an EAT takes in somehow an agnostic position, since it may register and convey all sort of affective phenomena that are considered potentially relevant to the learning context in which it is deployed, regardless of whether they are supposed to hinder or foster learning processes and outcomes. At the same time, though, the EAT should build emotional meaning making and awareness on the ground of affective phenomena that are known to play a prominent role in learning processes and outcomes.

### Socio-Affective Competences in Learning {#socio-affective-competences}

Finally, a third approach in research about affect and learning focuses on empowering learners with skills, allowing them to deal with the social and emotional challenges that they face during various phases of the learning process. Oftentimes, the scope of this line of research goes beyond learning and educational settings, aiming at preparing learners -- especially in early educational programs -- to take advantage from their social and emotional skills in life more generally. Research of this third kind often -- but not always -- refers to the concept of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), which has a long tradition in education [see @osherAdvancingSciencePractice2016]. Brackett and colleagues [-@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019] provide a recent definition of SEL:

> Today, SEL refers to the process of integrating cognition, emotion, and behavior into teaching and learning such that adults and children build self- and social awareness skills, learn to manage their own and others' emotions and behavior, make responsible decisions, and build positive relationships.\
> --- [@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019, p. 144]

One extensive perspective on this form of social and emotional learning is represented by the RULER approach [@brackettEnhancingAcademicPerformance2012; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @hoffmannTeachingEmotionRegulation2020; @nathansonCreatingEmotionallyIntelligent2016], an acronym that stands for:

-   Recognizing emotions in oneself and others;
-   Understanding the causes and consequences of emotions;
-   Labeling emotions with a nuanced vocabulary;
-   Expressing emotions in accordance with cultural norms and social context;
-   Regulating emotions with helpful strategies.

The RULER approach relates to various psychological theories, among which the concept of emotional intelligence as originally posited by Salovey and Mayer [-@saloveyEmotionalIntelligence1990] and more recently updated in light of further development [@mayerAbilityModelEmotional2016]. According to the authors, emotional intelligence is an ability comprising four branches: (a) perceive emotions accurately, (b) use emotions to accurately facilitate thought, (c) understand emotions and emotional meanings, and (d) manage emotions in themselves and others.

Other models and conceptualization of emotional intelligence have emerged in the last few decades, either under the same or a different name [@chernissEmotionalIntelligenceClarification2010; @schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007; @murphyIntelligenceInterpersonalSensitivity2011; @lockeWhyEmotionalIntelligence2005; @hoemann2021]. In a recent scoping review conducted by Hoemann and colleagues [-@hoemann2021], the authors group these concepts under the banner of *emotional expertise* under the premise that they "share the observation that some people are better than others at a range of competencies related to understanding and experiencing emotions, and these competencies may help them lead healthier lives" (*ibid.*, p. 1160). From a more practical standpoint, there is nowadays a growing consensus in distinguishing between two different approaches to emotional intelligence or related formulations: one considers it a relative stable trait [*e.g.*, @petridesRoleTraitEmotional2004], the other an ability or competence that can be trained [*e.g.*, @mayerAbilityModelEmotional2016; @schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007] and also measured from a performance standpoint [@schlegelGenevaEmotionalCompetence2018]. This second conceptualization is more keen to the learning context, assuming that it is possible to act upon emotional expertise and make it evolve over time [@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007; @hoffmannTeachingEmotionRegulation2020].

Another line of inquiry bridging learning and affect relates to various forms of regulatory processes, which are considered fundamental to learning processes both at the individual and collective levels. A consistent body of research, for instance, refers to three types of regulatory processes: (1) self-regulated learning, (2) co-regulated learning, and (3) socially-shared regulation of learning [@jarvelaEnhancingSociallyShared2015; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016; @millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015; @winneWhatStateArt2015]. According to Miller and Hadwin [-@millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015, p. 574], regulation of learning "can be defined as an intentional, goal directed metacognitive activity in which learners and groups take strategic control of their actions (behaviour), thinking (cognitive), and beliefs (motivation, and emotions) in the context of dynamic social interactions". In self-regulated learning, the person intentionally acts upon her own internal states that may have effect on her learning process. In co-regulated learning, learners engage in mutual, but still individually-oriented, regulation of internal states, in an effort to improve the collaborative task. Finally, in socially-shared regulation, which emerges from the coordination of self- and co-regulated learning, the group as a whole becomes the target of the regulatory processes in a synchronized and productive manner (*ibid*).

This third line of inquiry, thus, consider affect in the light of integrated processes, which require both effort and *some* form of expertise for them to be instrumental to learning. This perspective resonates with the voluntary use of an EAT, which requires effort and inferential processes, but also with the possibility that the use of the EAT may contribute to better regulate socio-affective dynamics.

### Synthesis

This first section of the chapter presented a brief overview of three complementary research areas linking affect and learning. The implementation of an EAT relates to all three areas since it presupposes (1) that learning elicits affective phenomena, so that learners have affect-related information upon which they can reflect and that they can convey; (2) that affective phenomena experienced during learning have an impact on learning processes and outcomes depending on the specifics of the situation at hand, rather then on a predefined list of discrete affective states that always foster or hinder learning ; and (3) that for taking full advantage of the affect-related information, both at the intra- and inter-personal levels, some effort and expertise in conveying meaning with, and extrapolating meaning from emotional information is necessary.

## Affect-Aware Systems in Computer Mediated Learning Environments {#affect-aware-systems}

The pivotal role attributed to affective phenomena in learning and education at large has recently pushed several scholars to investigate modalities for, and benefits in endowing computer-mediated learning environments with systems that integrate affective phenomena [@arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @calvoFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @calvoFrontiersAffectAwareLearning2012; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @grawemeyerAffectiveLearningImproving2017; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @calvoAffectDetectionInterdisciplinary2010]. These systems, which are often referred to as affect-aware or emotion-aware systems (*ibid.*), may vary greatly in their complexity, scope, ways to measure affective phenomena, and use of the affective information. For instance, affective systems can be oriented -- exclusively, primarily or equally -- towards the learner's individual affective states, the collective affective states of a group sharing common learning processes and outcomes, the affective states of teachers, or even the affective states of computerized agents implemented into the system, such as embodied tutors [@cerneaGroupAffectiveTone2014; @craigEmoteAloudLearning2008; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @leeTeachersEmotionsEmotion2016; @mantySocioemotionalInteractionCollaborative2020; @naykkiSocioemotionalConflictCollaborative2014].

Even though affective systems are mainly driven by autonomic affect detection [@calvoAffectDetectionInterdisciplinary2010] and often aim at providing the learning environment with some form of adaptive intelligence, which reacts to or acts upon learners affective states [@dmelloFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017], recent and overarching contributions have attempted to put affective systems in computer-mediated learning environments into broader perspectives [@calvoFrontiersAffectAwareLearning2012; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @dmelloFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017]. It is therefore worth to take advantage of the extant literature to seek for commonalities and differences with respect to an EAT with the characteristics stated in the introduction.

### Affective Systems and Affective Computing

Affective systems can be broadly categorized according to the objectives of affective computing, an interdisciplinary field investigating "computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotions" [@picardAffectiveComputing2000, p. 3]. Picard [-@picardAffectiveComputing2009] identifies four, non mutually exclusive, research areas in affective computing:

1.  technologies for sensing, recognizing, modeling, and predicting emotional and affective states;
2.  methods for computers to respond intelligently and respectfully to handle perceived affective information;
3.  technology for displaying emotional information or mediating the expression or communication of emotion;
4.  computational mechanisms that stimulate internal emotions or implement their regulatory and biasing functions.

Affective systems in computer-mediated learning environments more often relate to the first two categories identified by Picard [@calvoFrontiersAffectAwareLearning2012; @dmelloFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017]. For instance, in their glossary to an overarching chapter on the integration of affect in advanced learning technologies, D'Mello and Graesser [@dmelloFeelingThinkingComputing2015, p. 2] define an affect-aware learning technology as "an intelligent technology that considers a learner's affective and cognitive states in its pedagogical decision making". The authors (*ibid.*) identify two ways in which affect-aware learning technologies manifest their *intelligence*: (1) by proactively inducing or impeding particular affective states, which are considered as either fostering or hindering learning; and (2) by reacting to specific affective states as they arise, for instance in an attempt to remedy to affective states that may undermine the overall learning experience (see above the general discussion about the interplay between learning and affect). More recently, Harley and colleagues [@harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017] have extended the dichotomy proposed by D'Mello and Graesser (*ibid.*) and adopted it in an effort to provide a theoretically-guided taxonomy for the development of emotion-aware learning technologies, which foster *positive* emotions. The taxonomy itself is not relevant for the present contribution, since it presupposes some form of *intelligence* in the system. It is nevertheless worth mentioning Harley and colleagues (*ibid.*) contribution, for it adopts Pekrun's Control-Value theory of achievement emotions [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006], already introduced above, as the guiding framework for the taxonomy, corroborating the importance to bridge techno-centric and theoretical approaches.

### An Interactional Approach to Affect[^1] {#interactional-approach-emotion}

At first blush, the third research area of affective computing identified by Picard [-@picardAffectiveComputing2009] stands out as the best match for an EAT: technology for displaying emotional information or mediating the expression or communication of emotion. According to Boehner and colleagues [-@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007], though, this particular line of research has been neglected in affective computing, whose mainstream approach considers emotion as an internal and individual phenomenon. They identify this mainstream approach to emotion as *informational*, which they qualify as "rooted in a longer laboratory-science tradition of studying emotion in which subjective experience is considered suspect, to be replaced by objective measures" [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007, p. 276]. The authors advocate instead an *interactional* approach, which (1) focus on how computers can help users understand their emotions, rather than how computers can understand users' emotions; and (2) sees emotions as a cultural, dynamic and social phenomena, constructed in action and interaction. The position taken by Boehener and colleagues (*ibid.*) is stated very clearly in this passage:

> The role of affective systems is not to transmit pre-existing emotional units, but to provide a resource for emotional meaning-making. Success of such a system is measured by whether users find the system's responses useful for interpreting, reflecting on, and experiencing their emotions. Evaluation does not aim at finding a user's original, "true" emotions, but in tracking how emotions are constructed and interpreted over time, and correlating these dynamics with aspects of system design.\
> --- @boehnerHowEmotionMade2007, p. 287

More recently, Cernea and Kerren [-@cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015], inspired by the work of Boehener and colleagues (*ibid*.), proposed a categorization of technologies *on the rise* for emotion-enhanced interaction. The authors main objective "was to focus on technologies that satisfy two main requirements: having been used increasingly often in affect detection for interaction purposes, and having a proven track of *portability*, *non-intrusiveness* and *low cost*" [@cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015, p. 72]. Even though the authors target more complex affective system -- often using multi-modal sensory information, such as tracking and recognizing facial expressions, eye-movements or pupil dilation, or brain-computer-interfaces -- the categorization they propose is relevant also to a *simpler* system. The authors identify three types of affective systems from an interactional stand-point, proposed here in an condensed form (*ibid.*, p. 78):

1.  *Emotion-adaptive systems*, which adapt interaction based on the use affective state *or* mimic affective states with the purpose of enhancing the user experience and efficiency;
2.  *Emotion modeling systems*, which do not simply adapt to user affective states, but try to influence these states as well;
3.  *Affective-awareness systems*, designed to improve affective self-awareness of a user (i.e., internal affective awareness) *or* awareness of the emotions of other users (i.e., external affective awareness), for instance, in collaborative or competitive environments.

An EAT belongs clearly to the last category of *affective-awareness systems*. The presence of this category corroborates the fact that emotional awareness is considered crucial also from an affective computing perspective.

### Emotion-Aware Systems in E-Learning

Examples of contribution from an *affective-awareness systems* perspective mainly driven by affective computing is provided by Feidakis and colleagues [@feidakisEndowingElearningSystems2011; @feidakisProvidingEmotionAwareness2014; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016], who investigated emotion-aware systems in computer-mediated environments, both from theoretical and empirical perspectives, highlighting though that the topic has received so far limited attention. Their work is also primarily concerned with intelligent learning environments, but some of their contribution have more similarities with the use of an EAT as posited in the present thesis.

For instance, the authors draw extensively from emotion theories [@feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @feidakisProvidingEmotionAwareness2014]. Furthermore, in an overarching review of emotion-aware systems for e-learning, Feidakis and colleagues [-@feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016, p. 217] define emotion awareness as "the *implicit* or *explicit collection of emotion data* and the *recognition* of *emotion patterns*" (italics in the text). They therefore draw a distinction between data derived from autonomic affect detection (implicit), and data provided through first-person subjective report of feelings (explicit). Feidakis and colleagues' work is also relevant to the present contribution because they advocate the adoption of emotion-aware systems into *simpler* learning management systems, whereas affective systems are often deployed in more technology-intensive settings, such as virtual environments or educational games.

### Affective Feedback

Affective systems often -- but not always -- complement affective detection with what are commonly referred to as *affective feedbacks* [@arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @feidakisProvidingEmotionAwareness2014; @grawemeyerAffectiveLearningImproving2017; @robisonEvaluatingConsequencesAffective2009], which are often distinguished from more traditional *cognitive feedbacks* [@nelsonNatureFeedbackHow2009]. As the field more generally, affective feedbacks in affective systems are a recent line of inquire and the extant literature is therefore very cautious about their deployment and efficacy, as well as the very nature of what represents an affective feedback (*ibid*.). Broadly speaking, an affective feedback is a reaction of the system that explicitly targets the affective phenomena detected and attempts to instrumentally act upon it to improve learners' situation, either from an affective (*e.g.*, *empathetic*) or task-oriented point of view [@robisonEvaluatingConsequencesAffective2009].

Affective feedback is tightly related to a form of *intelligence* in affective systems, which computes appropriate treatment and useful output, and is therefore outside the scope of a simpler system. They nevertheless call for attention in evaluating whether emotional expression can be effective on itself, or it should be coupled with some form of feedback from the system.

### Self-Report From An Affective Computing Perspective

A last element of interest that can be derived from the literature driven mainly by an affective computing perspective concerns how self-report is assessed. Given that this field makes extensive use of autonomic identification of affective phenomena, it is of interest to seek for identified drawbacks in the use of a voluntary, self-report tool. Views from an affective computing perspective can therefore complement, with information derived from computer-mediated environment, more *traditional* assessment about validity and reliability of self-report in measuring affective phenomena [*e.g.*, @maussMeasuresEmotionReview2009; @mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005].

In an overarching contribution about measuring emotions in computer-mediated learning environments -- referred to as Computer-Based Learning Environments (CBLE) -- Harley [@harleyMeasuringEmotionsSurvey2015] reviews four main methodologies: facial expression coding, body posture and physiological measurement devices, log file data, and self-report measures. The author confirms that self-report is a widely adopted method of measure even in CBLE, which can be administered before, during or after the learning activities. It has the advantage of being easy to administer, and collected data are generally also easy to analyze and compare, especially when the self-report consists of a set of discrete affective states. On the other hand, though, Harley (*ibid.*), points out that self-report is an *off-line* measure, since learners must divert their attention from the learning activity to the self-report measure. This diversion is particularly disrupting when the self-report is asked at frequent intervals, or is repetitive in its administration. These seem the main drawbacks that are specific, or at least of particular relevance, to CBLE. Other drawbacks identified in the contribution are in fact shared with general and known shortcomings in self-report measures more generally, and can be roughly divided in: (a) authenticity of reported experience; (b) unwillingness to disclose one's own affective experience for normative pressure or social desirability; (c) latency time between the felt affective phenomena and the report, which may introduce bias in recollection; and (d) the action of self-reporting may elicit corollary phenomenon that modifies the original affective state [@harleyMeasuringEmotionsSurvey2015; @maussMeasuresEmotionReview2009; @mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005].

### Synthesis

This section provided an overview of affective systems implemented in computer-mediated learning environments from perspectives mainly driven by affective computing. The literature provides similarities between affective systems and an EAT as the one prospected in the thesis. First, there is a growing interest in affective computing for *interactional* affective technologies that provide users with the possibility to impinge on emotion meaning-making. Second, emotional awareness is an active research topic in affective computing, and in computer-mediated learning environments more specifically. Third, even though the field of affective computing was originally theory-agnostic and more focused on technical features in affect detection and processing [@calvoAffectDetectionInterdisciplinary2010], recent developments in the field corroborate a more tight relationship with theories, which can be beneficial in both direction: theory can inform affective systems, and affective systems can inform theory [@calvoAffectDetectionInterdisciplinary2010; @marsellaComputationalModelsEmotion2010; @schererBlueprintAffectiveComputing2010; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014].

On the other hand, most affective systems make the assumption that specific affective phenomena can hinder or foster learning and, congruently, deploy proactive or reactive strategies to intervene in the process. As stated in the introduction, the kind of EAT targeted by the thesis attempts to maintain a certain degree of agnosticism towards the instrumentality of specific affective phenomena and bestow learners with the responsibility to integrate the emotional information at hand. In this sense, an EAT is therefore closer to an awareness tool than it is to an affective system. The next section thus proposes an overview of the literature on awareness tools.

## Awareness Tools in Computer-Mediated Learning Environments {#awareness-tools}

Whereas affective systems in computer-mediated learning environments stem directly from affective computing, that is, from an affect-centered approach, awareness tools adopted in learning settings mainly originated from research in Computer-Mediated Communication [@baltesComputerMediatedCommunicationGroup2002; @lickliderComputerCommunicationDevice1968; @fjermestadAnalysisCommunicationMode2004] and Computer-Supported Cooperative (or Collaborative) Work [@dourishAwarenessCoordinationShared1992; @grossUsercenteredAwarenessComputersupported2005; @grudinComputerSupportedCooperativeWork1994]. Consequently, they are essentially driven by an inter-personal perspective, complying with the need to provide users sharing a computer-mediated environment with instrumental information about others to perform the task at hand [@dourishAwarenessCoordinationShared1992; @gutwinDescriptiveFrameworkWorkspace2002; @gutwinWorkspaceAwarenessRealtime1996; @schmidtProblemAwareness2002]. The transition and integration of that heritage in learning settings span different disciplines and approaches, encompassing perspectives that go beyondcommunication or cooperation perspective, and delves in learning psychology and instructional design [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @engelmannKnowledgeAwarenessCSCL2009; @janssenGroupAwarenessTools2011; @kirschnerAwarenessCognitiveSocial2015; @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017; @tuRelationshipSocialPresence2002; @jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010]. As a result, the concept of *awareness* covers a wide range of intra- and inter-subjective processes that may sustain learning processes and outcomes at different levels -- cognitive, social and affective (*ibid.*) -- and foster regulation at the three levels identified above: self-regulation, co-regulation, and socially shared regulation [@jarvelaEnhancingSociallyShared2015; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016; @millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015; @winneWhatStateArt2015].

This section provides at first an overview of the literature related to the flexible notion of *awareness* in computer-mediated learning environments, starting by a functional definition of the concept. Next, it focuses on awareness tools more specifically, by highlighting how current trends in the interpretation of the role of these tools are compatible with emotional awareness.

### Awareness Results from Displaying and Monitoring Functions {#displaying-monitoring-functions}

As stated in the preamble of this section, the term awareness in the context of awareness tools emerged primarily from the fields of Computer-Mediated Collaboration (CMC) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) as a means to overcome reduced contextual information in computer-mediated environment with respect to face-to-face interaction [@bodemerGroupAwarenessCSCL2011; @buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @grossUsercenteredAwarenessComputersupported2005; @schmidtProblemAwareness2002]. According to Schmidt [-@schmidtProblemAwareness2002, p. 287], though, "[t]he very word 'awareness' is one of those highly elastic English words that can be used to mean a host of different things. Depending on the context it may mean anything from consciousness or knowledge to attention or sentience, and from sensitivity or apperception to acquaintance or recollection". As a consequence, thus, even within CMC and CSCW, the concept has been used with different meanings, with often various preceding adjectives that attempted to better qualify the phenomenon such as *general awareness*, *collaboration awareness*, *peripheral awareness*, *background awareness*, *passive awareness*, *reciprocal awareness*, *mutual awareness*, or *workspace awareness* [@schmidtProblemAwareness2002, p. 286-287 citing use in other articles]. Schmidt (*ibid.*) argues that such attempts are doomed to fail, because awareness is not a distinct mental state that exists *per se*: it rather refers to being aware about something, and it is *that* something that determines what awareness is.

Schmidt reckons that there are two intertwined functions that allow awareness to emerge. First, information must be made available, or produced, for awareness to be possible. Schmidt define this function as *displaying*. The emergence is nevertheless not enough, information must also be perceived, or consumed, so Schmidt define a second necessary function, which consists in *monitoring* the computer-mediated environment in search of displayed information. As a consequence, awareness "is not the product of passively acquired 'information' but is a characterization of some highly active and highly skilled practices" [@schmidtProblemAwareness2002, p. 293]. In the reminder of the section and the manuscript, awareness is therefore considered in functional terms as the result from the interaction of displaying and monitoring instrumental information.

### Instrumental Information in Computer-Mediated Learning Environments {#instrumental-awareness}

Defining awareness as the function of displaying and monitoring instrumental information determines the need to frame what is considered as instrumental information. In this regard, when the concept of awareness was transferred into the context of learning, a change of perspective materialized on some important aspects, which are here resumed in three separated points, even though there is ample overlapping and interaction among them.

First, there is a growing consensus in considering that awareness in computer-mediated learning environment should not attempt to reproduce the face-to-face golden standard [@bodemerGroupAwarenessCSCL2011; @buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenGroupAwarenessTools2011; @kirschnerAwarenessCognitiveSocial2015]. This perspective is warranted by two intertwined assumptions.

On the one hand, the *universal* primacy of face-to-face over computer-mediated interactions has been challenged by several scholars [@baltesComputerMediatedCommunicationGroup2002; @derksRoleEmotionComputermediated2008; @fjermestadAnalysisCommunicationMode2004; @stoneUnderstandingCoordinationComputermediated2008]. Even though the absence of para-verbal cues that are usually available in face-to-face interactions may impoverish inter-personal dynamics, endowing computer-mediated learning environment with seamless audio/video connection is not the solution to all problems (*ibid*.), especially in asynchronous situations. Rather than the quality of the information provided, in fact, face-to-face interaction increases the possibility and frequency of social exchanges that can sustain learning processes, even in informal or auxiliary forms [@kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003; @kreijnsSocialAspectsCSCL2013]. Kirschner and colleagues [-@kreijnsSocialAspectsCSCL2013], for instance, provide the example of the water cooler as a *social affordance* (*ibid.*), which prompts learners to gather and talk about various aspects of their learning experience. According to the authors, thus, computer-mediated learning environments should not only provide the equivalent of the water cooler, but also ensure that learners use it, since the mere availability of social affordances does not assure neither their use, nor their effectiveness [@kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003].

On the other hand, information and communication technologies available in computer-mediated environments allow learners and instructional designers to provide information that is not necessarily available -- or at least hard to notice, process or remember -- in face-to-face interaction [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011]. In other words, rather then reproduce the contextual information available in face-to-face interaction, instructional designer should endow computer-mediated learning environments with content, activities, or technological artifacts that leverage on computational and human-computer interaction principles to improve learning processes and outcomes. For instance, learners could display their background knowledge about the topic at hand and monitor previous knowledge of their colleagues [@dehlerGuidingKnowledgeCommunication2011; @sanginFacilitatingPeerKnowledge2011], reducing the difficulty in judging what someone knows about a subject [@nickersonHowWeKnow1999; @nickersonProjectiveWayKnowing2001]. Another possibility provided by computer-mediated environment consists in sharing information about learners' levels of participation in collaborative or cooperative settings [@janssenGroupAwarenessTools2011], which may contribute to reduce free-riding and social loafing behaviors [@karauInterpersonalRelationsGroup1993; @salasMeasuringTeamCohesion2015].

Second, even though awareness is considered a secondary -- or corollary -- source of information with respect to the *content* of the learning activity [@janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013], scholars are considering a more flexible approach to the amount of resources that can or should be oriented to displaying and monitoring instrumental information that is not directly related to the learning outcome [@dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016; @bodemerGroupAwarenessCSCL2011; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003]. Rather than minimizing at all costs exogenous activities in an attempt to limit distraction and interference caused by a dual-task [@pashlerDualtaskInterferenceSimple1994], researchers are contemplating trade-offs based on the ratio between the effort of displaying and monitoring information, and the benefit resulting from disposing of that information [@dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016]. This trade-off is particularly important since researchers agree that awareness seldom emerges as a natural by-product of the learning task *per se*, but rather needs to be appropriately enhanced [@bodemerGroupAwarenessCSCL2011; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003]. In this regard, two non-mutually exclusive pedagogical strategies are often identified in the literature as a means to enact awareness: *scripting tools* and *group awareness tools* [*e.g.*, @millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015].

Scripting tools [*e.g.*, @dillenbourgOverscriptingCSCLRisks2002; @fischerScriptTheoryGuidance2013] are mainly adopted to scaffold the learning process, so that awareness is created as the results of planned interactions. In other words, learning is organized as a sequence of steps, where some or all of these steps foster or require the emergence of awareness, by explicitly asking learners to display and monitor instrumental information. A simple -- and questionable -- example of this process are the many cases of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which prompt thousands of users, located all over the world, to present themselves to others, often by posting a message in a forum with information about themselves and their learning goals. More elaborate scripts may require learners to engage in collaborative or argumentative activities, negotiation of goals and means to attain them, or discussion between peers about the quality of productions or interactions (*ibid*). The common factor shared by all the possible activities is the fact that awareness is mainly produced by the *script*, that is, by the learning design itself.

Group awareness tools [*e.g.*, @buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @engelmannKnowledgeAwarenessCSCL2009; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013], often shortened in awareness tools, on the other hand, take a different and mainly unstructured perspective. Rather than sequencing specific moments or activities during which awareness is enacted, group awareness tools bestow learners with the responsibility of displaying and monitoring information whenever it is considered appropriate and instrumental to the learning activity (*ibid.*). In other words, group awareness tools are usually integrated alongside the learning activity -- persistently or *on demand* -- and support learners in making others aware of one's instrumental information, as well as becoming aware of others' instrumental information. As stated by Miller and Hadwin [-@millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015. p. 582], compared to scripting tools, "group awareness tools take a more non-directive or reactive approach placing the locus of control in the hands of the learners". In this regard, Buder [-@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011] -- adopting Schmidt [-@schmidtProblemAwareness2002] functional definition of awareness in learning contexts -- identifies eight features of awareness tools about which the trade-off between effort and benefit of bestowing learners with the locus of control should be assessed. For the displaying function, Buder (*ibid*) identifies the following four features:

-   To what extent information is displayed explicitly or implicitly, with explicit information demanding more effort and therefore potentially interfering more with ongoing learning activity, but also providing more meaningful and reflected-upon information;
-   The frequency by which new information is provided, which is inherently linked with the previous feature insofar as the information is displayed explicitly;
-   To what extent information is displayed voluntarily or is enforced by the system, for instance by blocking other interactions with the computer-mediated environment until the information is not provided;
-   To what extent information is displayed in a closed (*i.e.*, structured) or open (*i.e.*, unstructured) format, where closed formats usually foster immediacy but limit freedom, for instance by clicking a pre-determined choice, whereas open formats allow more flexibility (*e.g.*, a text field where learners can type whatever they see fit).

With respect to the monitoring function, Buder (*ibid*.) identifies four other features on which trade-offs in noticing and processing the available information should be assessed. These features are the following:

-   To what extent available information is integrated with the learning content or activity, assuming that, in general, the more distant the information, the greater the effort necessary to switch between the primary learning task and auxiliary awareness;
-   To what extent available *chunks* of information are easy or hard to process. For instance, information may be aggregated or graphically represented to foster comparison between information belonging to the learner herself and information provided by other participants to the computer-mediated learning environment;
-   To what extent available information foster or pressure the display of further information. Learners may benefit from the social affordance provided by the tool, which reminds them of the interest to share instrumental information; but may also feel coerced to share information by normative pressure, for instance in an attempt to level-up and match the amount of information provided by others;
-   To what extent available information prompts immediate or diffuse consequences on learners behavior. Immediate consequences may be of proximal instrumentality, but also disrupt the course of action; whereas diffuse consequences are more flexible, but may require more meta-cognitive and reflective efforts.

Third, even though there is a tendency to divide group awareness tools in three categories -- *behavioral awareness*, *cognitive awareness*, or *social awareness* [@bodemerGroupAwarenessCSCL2011] -- depending on the information they provide, there is also an increasing consensus in considering these categories as non-mutually exclusive, allowing interactions or spill-over effects between *types* of awareness [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013; @kirschnerAwarenessCognitiveSocial2015]. Furthermore, social and affective dimensions are receiving increasing attention in an attempt to compensate "the tendency to restrict social interaction to educational interventions aimed at cognitive processes while social (psychological) interventions aimed at socio-emotional processes are ignored, neglected or forgotten" [@kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003, p. 336]. In this regard, the next two subsections provide examples of theories that integrate the concept of awareness from cognitive, social, and affective perspectives in computer-mediated learning contexts: social presence in distance learning, and mutual-modeling in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning.

### Social Presence in Distance Learning {#social-presence-distance-learning}

The broad concept of awareness can be related with issues that have been identified in the last few decades about the articulation between distance learning and the need for *social presence*, especially in higher-education [@bates2005technology; @garrisonFirstDecadeCommunity2010; @jacquinotApprivoiserDistanceSupprimer1993; @jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003; @rourkeAssessingSocialPresence2001; @tuRelationshipSocialPresence2002]. The definition of social presence and whether this presence is a necessary element for learning to happen is still source of lively debate [@jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010; @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017; @rourkeLearningCommunitiesInquiry2009; @kirschnerAwarenessCognitiveSocial2015]. For instance, Lowenthal and Snelson [-@lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017] recently collected definitions from the most cited articles on social presence and identified five categories in which different definitions could be divided into (*ibid.*, see Table 1 in the original article, p. 144):

-   Social presence as *being there*, as in the definition by Dunlap and Lowenthal (2009): "the degree of salience (i.e., quality or state of 'being there') between two communicators";
-   Social presence as *being real*, as in the definition by Gunawardena and Zittle (1997): "the degree to which a person is perceived as 'real' in mediated communication";
-   Social presence as *projecting*, as in the definition by Rourke and colleagues (1999): "the ability of learners to project themselves socially and affectively into a community of inquiry";
-   Social presence as *connecting*, as in the definition by Tu (2002): "the degree of feeling, perception, and reaction of being connected on CMC [computer-mediated communication] to another intellectual entity";
-   Social presence as *belonging*, as in the definition by Picciano (2002): "a student's sense of being in and belonging in a course and the ability to interact with other students and an instructor".

Another definition of particular interest to the present contribution is provided by Kreijins and colleagues [-@kreijnsMeasuringPerceivedSocial2011, p. 366], who define social presence "as the degree of illusion that others appear to be a 'real' physical persons in either an immediate (i.e., real time/synchronous) or a delayed (i.e., time-deferred/asynchronous) communication episode". This definition explicitly refers to the synchronous and asynchronous temporal dimensions, which are of interest in the empirical contributions in Part III.

The debate about which category or specific definition better defines social presence, though, is beyond the scope of the present contribution, for which rather than the differences, it is worth pointing out commonalities, especially in considering socio-affective phenomena. In this regard, the definition of Rourke and colleagues (1999) clearly cites affect as a necessary dimension for learners' to project themselves in the social *milieu*, in which learning happens. Vaughan and Garrison (2005), cited in @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017, states it very similarly: "social presence refers to the potential of participants to project themselves socially and emotionally". A view shared by Swan and colleagues (2008), also cited in @lowenthalSearchBetterUnderstanding2017, for whom "social presence refers to the degree to which learners feel socially and emotionally connected with others in an online environment". In the work of Jézégou [-@jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010], *socio-affective presence* is one of the three fundamental dimensions of social presence alongside *cognitive presence* and *pedagogical presence*. According to Jézégou (*ibid*):

> the socio-affective presence in e-learning allows to support the cognitive presence resulting from learners' transactions to solve a problematic situation. It is generated by social interactions that contribute to establishing the symmetry of the relationship and the friendliness between learners, thus creating a socio-affective climate that is favorable to transactions within a digital communication space.\
> --- @jezegouCreerPresenceDistance2010, p. 267, our translation from French.

There is therefore a growing consensus in considering affective phenomena as an integral part of social presence in distance learning. Displaying and monitoring information about learners' affective states can therefore contribute to enhance the social presence in computer-mediated learning environments.

### Mutual Modeling in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning {#mutual-modeling}

Another field of research that widely adopts awareness as a focal concept is Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) [@dillenbourgEvolutionResearchComputersupported2009; @dillenbourgWhatYouMean1999; @stahlComputersupportedCollaborativeLearning2006; @suthersTechnologyAffordancesIntersubjective2006]. Even though the field is not limited to distance learning, but encompasses the use of computational devices also in face-to-face interaction, research in CSCL has, from the very beginning in the 1990's, reckoned the importance for learners to build a *shared-understanding* of the learning activity [@dillenbourgEvolutionResearchComputersupported2009; @dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016; @roschelleConstructionSharedKnowledge1995]. For instance, Suthers [@suthersTechnologyAffordancesIntersubjective2006, p. 332] posits that CSCL is characterized by "processes of intersubjective meaning making and how technological affordances mediate or support such processes". Technology affordances are defined by Norman [-@normanDesignEverydayThings2013, p. 11] as the "relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used" [see also @pucilloFrameworkUserExperience2014; @rizzoOriginDesignIntentional2006; @turnerAffordanceContext2005].

According to Dillenbourg and colleagues [-@dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016], learners must engage in two intertwined processes to achieve shared understanding and inter-subjecitive meaning making: (1) a learner has to build and maintain a holistic representation of the colleagues with whom she shares the learning activity; and (2) the very same colleagues must possess sufficient information to build and update a holistic representation of the learner herself. Dillenbourg and colleagues define the former process as *partner modeling* -- that is "the process of inferring one's partner's mental states" (*ibid*, p. 230) -- and the latter as *mutual modeling*, that is, *bi-directional* partner-modeling, which may happen at various nested levels (*e.g.* Jane speculates that Paul is aware of the fact that she expects him to be more involved in the argumentation).

It is posited, in fact, that the effort learners put into building a symmetrical representation of the partners in a collaborative task is a pivotal determinant of learning processes and, by extension, outcomes [@dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016; @molinariKnowledgeInterdependencePartner2009; @sanginFacilitatingPeerKnowledge2011]. In this regard, it is useful to point out some important elements. First, symmetry does not mean that all implicated learners must do, think, know, or feel the same thing. On the contrary, collaborative efforts are inherently characterized by fluctuations between socio-cognitive tensions and relaxations, which are instrumental to the learning process [@andriessenSociocognitiveTensionCollaborative2011; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016; @winneWhatStateArt2015]. Second, unlike other similar concepts implicating interpersonal accuracy [see @hallSocialPsychologyPerceiving2018 for an integrative overview], mutual-modeling does not have to be persistently and precisely accurate, because that would require an effort that may take resources away from the learning activity [@dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016]. Mutual-modeling is therefore particularly important at times when there are events of major concern for learners, who may benefit from cues about the suitability of persisting with or changing their behavior -- a process that, as we will see later, incidentally shares many commonalities with eliciting events in emotions [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. Finally, even though mutual-modeling is mainly driven from a communicative point of view [@clarkGroundingCommunication1991], it also encompasses a broader variety of sources of information, such as what a person does, thinks, wants, or -- precisely -- feels about herself or about their colleagues [@bodemerGroupAwarenessCSCL2011; @dillenbourgSymmetryPartnerModelling2016; @engelmannKnowledgeAwarenessCSCL2009; @kirschnerAwarenessCognitiveSocial2015; @sanginFacilitatingPeerKnowledge2011; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012].

An example of this integrated perspective is provided by Janssen and Bodemer [@janssenCoordinatedComputerSupportedCollaborative2013], which argue against a clear-cut separation between cognitive and social awareness. In their framework, illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:janssen-bodemer-framework), the authors suggest that there is inter-dependency between cognitive and social information on the one side, and the content and relational space in which the collaboration takes place on the other side. As it will more thoroughly illustrated in Chapter \@ref(eat-general-chapter), emotions are known to play a prominent role both cognitively and socially, and are therefore particularly suited to integrate information at different levels.

### Synthesis

This section provided an overview of the literature about awareness tools in computer-mediated learning environment as a means to display and monitor instrumental information for learning processes and outcomes. The section highlighted how the flexible concept of awareness encompasses a wide variety of potential sources of instrumental information. In this regard, there is an increasing convergence in considering affective phenomena as viable information, for instance, to build and update a social presence in remote learning environment or a holistic representation of the partners in a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning task. The literature on awareness tools also points out that these tools bestow learners with the locus of control in making the best out of the information provided through the awareness tool. That is, it is mostly up to learners (1) to decide when to display or monitor the information; and (2) how to extrapolate meaning from the available information and integrate it in their course of action during the learning activity.

## Summary

This chapter provided an overview of the interplay between affect and learning from different perspectives. In computer-mediated learning environments in particular, affective information is integrated through the use of technological artifacts, which provide learners with the possibility to express and perceive affect-related information considered to be instrumental for learning processes and outcomes. This theoretical convergence about the instrumentality of affect-related information therefore needs a concrete, technical way to be implemented. In this regard, this chapter highlighted some features of affect-aware systems on the one hand, and of awareness tools on the other, which have contributed to define a broad sketch of some of the features an EAT should provide, as well as some of the conditions or intervening factors that may influence its use and usefulness. Compared to affective systems, awareness tools are more aligned with the type of EAT contemplated by the present contribution. In the meantime, awareness tools are mostly oriented by the idea that *others* could benefit from information provided by oneself, whereas the individual benefits of displaying information are considered to a lesser extent. As previously mentioned, affective phenomena are not often central in learning environments, and therefore emotional *self-awareness* may also play a prominent role in an EAT. These aspects are further defined in the following chapter.
