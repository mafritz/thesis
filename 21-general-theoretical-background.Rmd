This chapter provides an overview of the extant literature, combining different sources of scientific knowledge, which corroborate the interest for endowing distance learning settings with emotional awareness. The overall perspective adopted in the chapter is therefore rather inductive, with a collection of theories and empirical evidence that support the pertinence of emotional awareness. A *bona fide*, uncritical approach to the extant literature is warranted by two intertwined reasons. First, there is consensus among different scholars about the fact that the scientific study of emotion in learning -- and distance learning more specifically -- is a recent line of inquiry [@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @graesserEmotionsAdvancedLearning2014; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018]. At such an early stage, a *loosening*, rather than a *tightening* approach can therefore help cross-fertilization and discover elements of interest [@fiedlerCycleTheoryFormation2004]^[This is limited, though, to the scientific inquiry, whereas in an applied context, caution should be taken not to *play with people's feelings*]. Second, considering the dependency of emotional awareness from technology in the context of distance learning, it remains to be determined whether emotional awareness can lead to theory formation, in the sense of a causal network of risky predictions about phenomena of interest, or it has *only* the potential to intervene as a technological support, regardless of its  explanatory power [@meehlAppraisingAmendingTheories1990]. In other words, if it were to be found that endowing distance learning with emotional awareness results in beneficial effects for learners, it may be *deployed* as-if, waiting for theoretical explanations to *tighten* its causal effects at a later stage [@fiedlerCycleTheoryFormation2004; @meehlAppraisingAmendingTheories1990; @scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020]. 

The chapters starts with an organized, but essential, overview of current trends in learning psychology and education sciences, which consider the interplay between affect and learning as a crucial interaction to foster learning processes and outcomes. Second, it illustrates how the rationale behind the instrumentality of emotional awareness in distance learning settings emerges from the convergence of multiple disciplines and perspectives, comprising -- but not limited to -- psychological theories about the pivotal role affect plays at the intra- and inter-personal levels; trends in computer-mediated communication and collaboration to implement awareness tools in technology enhanced environments; and current perspectives in the field of affective computing, which aims at empowering learning environments with affect- and emotion-aware systems. The last part of the chapter points out some methodological challenges in the scientific inquiry of emotional awareness. One of these challenges, specifically, relates to differences in the interpretation and use of the concept *emotion*, which is a topic discussed at length in the next chapter. Until a formal definition of *emotion*, thus, the more general term *affect* is often adopted in the narrative structure of the text, whereas -- as stated in the introduction -- an effort will be made to maintain authors' use of the term adopted in their work.

## Affect and Learning

The interplay between affect and learning is being investigated at various level of granularity, from the micro-level of neuroscience [*e.g.*, @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016] to the macro-level of how education curricula and institution should reform their programs in order to take affective experiences into account [*e.g.*, @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019]. Rather than a layered analysis, though, this section proposes a selection of contributions -- privileging research related to learning with technology whenever possible -- organized in three non-mutually exclusive and highly intertwined categories: (1) research that focuses *primarily* on the effects of learning processes and outcomes on affect; (2) research that focuses *primarily* on the effects of affect on learning processes and outcomes; and (3) research that focuses *primarily* on how either or both directional effects can be mediated or moderated by various forms of socio-affective competences such as emotional intelligence, intrinsic or extrinsic emotion regulation, and the like. This division is adopted mainly for easing the illustration of various contributions and is not fundamental for the remainder of the manuscript. The main aim of the section is to depict an overall and growing cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary interest in considering learning as the results of cognitive, social, and affective interactions, in which the study of emotional awareness can be easily integrated. 

### The Effects of Learning on Affect

Research investigating the effect of learning on affective phenomena is primarily concerned in determining what affective reactions are elicited by learning processes and situations, and what are the reasons and mechanisms that concur in eliciting such reactions. According to Pekrun [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005], for instance, the scientific study of emotion in education emerged in the last few decades by extension of previous work that was primarily focused on reducing anxiety during test exams. Based on this premise, Pekrun set forth an overarching theory, named the *Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions* [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006], which accounts for eliciting mechanisms and consequences of learning situations where some form of achievement is at stake (*e.g.*, passing an exam). The theory states that learners evaluate their learning experience according to two criteria: the subjective control that learners feel over the learning process, and the intrinsic value that they confer to the achievement outcome. Different emotions, such as frustration, enjoyment, or boredom, are then elicited based on the specific evaluation that learners make about the situation, combined with the temporal dimension of the evaluation, that is, whether it is retrospective, perspective, or ongoing. The Control-Value theory is depicted more thoroughly in the next chapter, but is presented here as a line of inquiry that aims at explaining how and why certain emotions are elicited by learning processes. 

Other contributions address the effect of learning on affective phenomena without necessarily proposing an eliciting mechanism, but focusing on the kind and frequency of specific affective experiences emerging from learning experiences, which is in itself valuable knowledge both for instructional designers and researchers. Of particular interest to the present thesis, for instance, is a recent selective meta-analysis conducted by D'Mello [-@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013] on affective states experienced during individual learning with technology. Combining 24 studies from 5 different countries and from different level of formal education (from middle school to adult students), D'Mello (*ibid.*) computed the relative frequency of different affective states recorded from different sources, from self-report to retrospective video analysis from trained judges. Results show that only one affective state, defined as *engagement/flow*, was consistently frequent in most of the studies. More *traditional* affective reactions such as *anger*, *anxiety*, *boredom*, *fear*, *frustration*, *happiness*, *sadness* and *surprise* were either infrequent, or subject to great heterogeneity between studies.

Reis and colleagues [@reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018] performed a similar meta-analysis, but encompassing affective states during Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning [@dillenbourgEvolutionResearchComputersupported2009; @stahlComputersupportedCollaborativeLearning2006; @suthersTechnologyAffordancesIntersubjective2006], integrating thus also a collective, human-to-human interaction perspective. Starting from an initial corpus of over one thousand contributions between published articles and conference papers, the authors extracted 58 papers that met all the criteria they set forth. From this restricted corpus of articles, the authors computed the number of papers citing different discrete affective states, belonging to different categories of affective phenomena (personality traits, emotions, moods, and socio-emotional factors). With respect to affective states identified as emotion, the authors tallied 29 discrete emotions that appeared in a minimum of two and a maximum of eight papers. The most frequently cited discrete emotions appearing 4 times or more are: *angry*, *confused*, *disgust*, *pride*, and *tired* (in four papers); *curious*, *excited*, *interested*, *joy*, *sadness* and *surprise* (in five papers); *anxious*, *bored*, *relaxed* and *anger* (in six papers); *fear* (in seven papers); and *frustration* (in eight papers). The work of Reis and colleagues (*ibid*) was not limited to the frequency of affective states, but encompassed a broader perspective on the past and future of the study of affective phenomena and will therefore be cited in other parts of this chapter.

This brief selection of contributions corroborates the fact that learning does indeed elicit affective phenomena. Research is therefore implicated in determining the mechanisms of elicitation, as well as explaining the determinants of variance in affective experiences according to different learning contexts, such as individual vs. collaborative. The implementation of an EAT can therefore leverage on this scenario. An EAT can in fact contribute to shed light on eliciting factors, by providing for instance useful information about when an emotion is elicited, and it can also be integrated in different learning situations to account for differences in the kind and frequency of experienced emotions.

### The Effects of Affect on Learning

Another line of inquiry, which is highly intertwined with the one illustrated in the previous subsection, aims at investigating whether specific affective states or reactions have effects on learning, for instance by fostering or hindering learning processes or outcomes. 

### Socio-Affective Competences in Learning

## The Rational Behind Emotional Awareness

### Intra-Personal Functions of Affect

#### The Emotion As Social Information Theoretical Framework

### Inter-Personal Functions of Affect

#### Social Functions of Emotion

The social and cultural function of emotion may therefore have been built upon a *feature* that has evolved particularly in some species, such as human beings, for which inter-personal relations are pivotal to survival and, less dramatically, well-being [@parkinsonEmotionSocialRelations2005; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999]. Keltner and Haidt [-@keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999] identify four level of analysis in which emotion play a social function: (1) the individual level, whenever the source of the emotion is of a social nature -- which, for some scholars, means most if not all of the time [@fischerWhereHaveAll2010; @parkinsonEmotionsAreSocial1996; @rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009]; (2) the dyadic level, such as in direct dialogue or collaboration; (3) the group-level, in which people share a common identities and goals to attain; and (4) the cultural level, where the analysis focus on macro-elements such as history and tradition. A recent overarching synthesis on the social function of emotions across all levels proposed by Fischer and Manstead [-@fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016] identifies two complementary, but distinct, functions performed by emotions: affiliation, and distancing. The affiliation function serves to form and maintain positive social relationship with others, whereas the distancing function helps in establishing and maintaining a social position relative to others. Other social functions of emotions, further developed below in the chapter, comprise the spontaneous tendency of people to share their emotions with others [@rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005], the use of emotional information to better understand behavior and appropriate conduct in social situations [@parkinsonEmotionsInterpersonalInteractions2010; @vankleefHowEmotionsRegulate2009], or situation in which people voluntary attempt to act upon emotions in others [@netzerInterpersonalInstrumentalEmotion2015; @reeckSocialRegulationEmotion2016; @zakiInterpersonalEmotionRegulation2013].

## Awareness

### Self-Awareness

### Group-Awareness

### Awareness Tools in Computer-Mediated Environments

## Affective Systems

As stated in the introduction, and EAT technically combines features of awareness tools, illustrated in the previous section, and of affective systems -- such as affect-aware or emotion-aware systems -- which are here broadly defined as computation and information systems, which explicitly target affective phenomena [@calvoFrontiersAffectAwareLearning2012; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @picardAffectiveComputing2000]. This section will gather both theoretical and applied contributions about affective systems, particularly in technology enhanced learning environments. This will provide the opportunity to relate, by comparison and contrasts, the implementation of an EAT as a technological artifact targeting affective phenomena, and emotion more particularly. 

### The Interactional Approach to Affective Computing

A first step in the process to position an EAT with respect to affective systems is to turn to the broad and relatively recent field named *affective computing* which refers to "computing
that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotions" [@picardAffectiveComputing2000, p. 3]. Picard^[Picard was the first to introduce the term *affective computing* and her experience is telling of how the study of emotion and affective computing more specifically have changed over the last few decades. In the introduction of her seminal book *Affective Computing*, Picard [-@picardAffectiveComputing2000] -- also cited in @boehnerHowEmotionMade2007, from which the idea to include this passage is taken, see below -- writes: "I never expected to write a book addressing emotions. My education has been dominated by science and engineering, and based on
axioms, laws, equations, rational thinking, and a pride that shuns the ‘touchy-feely.’ Being a woman in a field containing mostly men has provided extra incentive to cast off the stereotype of ‘emotional female’ in favor of the logical behavior of a scholar".] [-@picardAffectiveComputing2009] identifies four, non mutually exclusive, research areas:

1. Technologies for sensing, recognizing, modeling, and predicting emotional and affective states;
2. Methods for computers to respond intelligently and respectfully to handle perceived affective information;
3. Technology for displaying emotional information or mediating the expression or communication of emotion; 
4. Computational mechanisms that stimulate internal emotions or implement their regulatory and biasing functions.

At first blush, the third research area stands out as the best match for an EAT. The description perfectly fits with the main purpose of an EAT, which resonates with all the features proposed by the description: it aims at displaying emotional information, *and* mediate the expression *and* communication of emotion. According to Boehner and colleagues [-@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007], though, this particular line of research has been neglected in affective computing, whose mainstream approach considers emotion as an internal and individual phenomenon. They identify this mainstream approach to emotion as *informational*, which they qualify as "rooted in a longer laboratory-science tradition of studying emotion in which subjective experience is considered suspect, to be replaced by objective measures" [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007, p. 276]. The authors advocate instead an *interactional* approach, which (1) focus on how computers can help users understand their emotions, rather than how computers can understand users’ emotions; and (2) sees emotions as a cultural, dynamic and social phenomena, constructed in action and interaction. The position taken by Boehener and colleagues is very-well resumed by this passage that is worth citing at length, for it targets perfectly the main aim of an EAT (*ibid*. p. 287):

> The role of affective systems is not to transmit pre-existing emotional units, but to provide a resource for emotional meaning-making. Success of such a system is measured by whether users find the system’s responses useful for interpreting, reflecting on, and experiencing their emotions. Evaluation does not aim at finding a user’s original, *true* emotions, but in tracking
how emotions are constructed and interpreted over time, and correlating these dynamics with
aspects of system design. (The use of italic here replaces the quotation marks in the original article)

In support of this claim, the articles (*ibid.*) illustrate and compare different affective systems that have either an *informatinal* or *interactional* approach. For instance, one *interactional* system pertained precisely to the notion of emotional awareness. Co-workers in a shared space were asked to fill a survey about their emotions in real-time and, according to their responses, an abstract painting projected on a wall changed background color, the number and cluster of dots, and the speed of movement in the animation as a function of aggregates and averages of the survey responses. The authors report that co-workers were puzzled by the abstract representation, which contributed in fostering the co-construction of emotional meaning-making advocated in the *interactional* approach.
