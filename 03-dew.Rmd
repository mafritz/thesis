Being Emotional Awareness Tools (EAT) a recent subject of inquiry, there is still a lack of validated instruments to investigate the matter. This shortcoming is particularly relevant considering that the way emotional awareness is expressed and conveyed to others may be a major factor in determining and interpreting its effects. In other words, the EAT is not *simply* an auxiliary instrument [@meehlAppraisingAmendingTheories1990]; on the contrary, it is an integral part of the subject matter and therefore requires careful assessment on its own [@buderGroupAwarenessTools2011; @janssenGroupAwarenessTools2011]. 

This chapter illustrates the core feature of the Dynamic Emotion Wheel (DEW), the theory-driven, self-report, and moment-to-moment emotion awareness tool that will be implemented and assessed in two distance learning settings in the empirical contributions of the thesis. The DEW was originally conceived and developed as a prototype during my internship in the EATMINT project [@fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015; @fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2016; @fritzProvidingEmotionalAwareness2017; @fritzRealTimeEmotionalAwareness2016] and as the subject of my Master thesis [@fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015]. A more thorough description of the conception and development can therefore be found in Fritz [-@fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015]. This chapter recalls some of the key points of the DEW, in particular its connection with the Geneva Emotion Wheel [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005] and its core feature of implementing an underlying emotional structure into the tool. Then, it extends this connection by suggesting that the use of the DEW activates the theoretical concept of emotional competence as defined by Scherer [-@schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007], which comprises three sub-competences: (1) the appraisal, (2) the communication, and (3) the regulation sub-competences.

## The Geneva Emotion Wheel

The complexity and diversity in the field of emotion theories is reflected in different approaches on how emotions should be assessed and measured [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @maussMeasuresEmotionReview2009; @mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. In a componential approach to emotion, ideally, all aspects of the synchronized and unfolding process should be taken into account [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. Measuring all these aspects at once, though, requires dedicated material, some of which is difficult or impossible to deploy outside a laboratory. Self-report remains therefore a widely adopted method to ask a person about her emotional experience, either through *paper-and-pencil-like* questionnaire  [e.g. @harmon-jonesDiscreteEmotionsQuestionnaire2016; @pekrunMeasuringEmotionsEpistemic2016], or more elaborated self-report tools [see among others @broekensAffectButtonMethodReliable2013; @desmet2003measuring; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005;  @siegertAppropriateEmotionalLabelling2011; @bradleyMeasuringEmotionSelfAssessment1994; @caicedoHowYouFeel2006; @isomursuExperimentalEvaluationFive2007; @molinariEMORELOutilReporting2016].  With respect to more elaborate tools in particular, Scherer [-@schererWhatAreEmotions2005, p. 721] advocates some of the characteristics an emotion self-report tool should provide:

* Concentrate on the feeling component of emotion;
* Avoid the simple valence-arousal space;
* Rely on natural language labels;
* Allow the assessment of the intensity of the feeling;
* Build some emotion structure into the instrument, rather than presenting arbitrary emotion sets;
* Adopt a user-friendly graphical user interface.

Driven by these tenets, Scherer [-@schererWhatAreEmotions2005] developed and refined over the years [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013] one of the most widely adopted emotion self-report tool: the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW). For instance, the GEW is also presented in an overarching chapter [@shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014] about emotion in the *International Handbook of Emotions in Education* [@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014], which is, to the best of my knowledge, the most up-to-date and comprehensive resource about emotion in education.

The GEW is an instrumental implementation of the Component Process Model theoretical framework [CPM; @sanderAppraisalDrivenComponentialApproach2018; @schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009]. It combines the two most widely adopted approaches to emotion self-report -- the dimensional and discrete emotions approaches [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005] -- by establishing a causal link between the appraisal [@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001] and the subjective feeling [@grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008] components -- that is, between the cognitive evaluation of the situation and the holistic experience that usually emerges to consciousness as a natural language word or idiom. This direct link is corroborated by recent empirical contributions investigating whether the emotional meaning of words often adopted, in different cultures, to express emotional experiences can be traced back to specific evaluations of the eliciting event [@fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @fontaineWhyWhatHow2013; @gentschEffectsAchievementContexts2017; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018].

include_graphics(here("figure/dew/gew-v3.png"))
```

The interface of the GEW, depicted in its third version in Figure \@ref(fig:gew-version-3-figure) [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013], presents 20 subjective feelings -- chosen with respect to their frequency in emotion literature and everyday language use -- organized in a circumplex, which is determined by two appraisal dimensions as axes: *Valence* on the abscissa and *Control/Power* on the ordinate. Each feeling is positioned according to a value along both axes and belongs thus to one of the four quadrants of the circumplex, determined by the combination of positive or negative Valence, and positive or negative Control/Power. From the origin of the axes stem 5 circles for each of the subjective feelings. The circles grow in size as they get closer to the edge of the circumplex, so that the first circle is the smallest, and the last one the biggest. Users can therefore choose, first, the *row* of circles that corresponds to the subjective feeling they are experiencing and, second, the intensity of the feeling as a function of the circle's size.

## The Dynamic Emotion Wheel

The GEW is a theory-driven and validated instrument that has been widely adopted in different experimental contexts. Nevertheless, from the point of view of an awareness tool, it has two major shortcomings. First, its size: the graphical interface of the GEW is too wide to be implemented alongside some other content, such as learning material or environment. Second, it is limited to self-report, and it does not provide a way for the emotional information to be stored and visualized after the expression [@bersetVisualisationDonneesRecherche2018; @hegartyCognitiveScienceVisualspatial2011; @leonyProvisionAwarenessLearners2013]. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I took advantage of the emotional structure implemented into the GEW to build a parsimonious computational model that allows users to actively rate the two appraisal dimensions of the GEW and suggest a subset of subjective feelings that are compatible with that particular combination of appraisal dimensions.

This sections begins with a brief overview of the DEW and then depicts how the emotional structure is fit into the tool with respect to the two main functions of an awareness tool: the expressing-displaying and the perceiving-monitoring function.

### Overview of the Dynamic Emotion Wheel

Introducing the overall interface of the DEW will ease the more detailed description of the specifics functions it serves. It is worth noting, though, that what is here presented is a configuration of the DEW that adopts and extends the same characteristics of the GEW. This is not, though, the only possible interface. The next chapter will introduce a research toolbox that precisely allows the configuration of different interfaces, which may be determined according to theoretical or practical needs of researchers interested in deploying the tool in their studies or practitioners aiming at implementing an EAT in their instructional design.
