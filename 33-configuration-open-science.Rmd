The previous chapter illustrated the parsimonious computational model linking appraisal dimensions and subjective feelings, which is the *core* of the proof of concept proposed by the thesis. This chapter introduces a toolbox built around the computational model, which allows the configuration of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) according to researchers and practitioners needs. As stated in the introduction, the implementation of a toolbox is driven by open science tenets, which advocate the need for investing in the development of open material that can foster transparency, sharing, comparison, replicability and reproducibility of research practices, measures and results [@Nosek1422; @chambersSevenDeadlySins2017; @scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020; @nelsonPsychologyRenaissance2018; @flakeMeasurementSchmeasurementQuestionable2020; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. The chapter starts by a general overview of the toolbox, which is divided in an area dedicated to researchers and practitioners, and the *end-user* interface of the tool integrated in a computer-mediated learning environment. The reminder of the Chapter then illustrates the available configuration options of how emotion is expressed-displayed and how emotion is perceived-monitored respectively. Finally, the Chapter describes some features of the toolbox that can be configured from an empirical point of view, as well as the measures that can be retrieved from the toolbox.

## General Presentation of the Toolbox

The toolbox is a web-based application that can also be installed on local machines in relatively few steps. The details are ignored here because this sort of information is likely to change over time, but the choice of a web-based application has been made to maximize ease of access to both researchers and users, with only a modern browser as a requirement. In fact, contrary to *pure* and individual self-report instruments, which may be administered in different settings with minimal adaptations, an EAT presents more challenging technical constraints, especially from a moment-to-moment and inter-personal perspective. Whenever synchronization between two or more *agents* sharing information is concerned, it is necessary to adopt a bi-directional communication technique, such as web socket. Most web applications are in fact based on the client-server architecture: the *agent* (the client) sends a request to the server, which responds back with the appropriate response (e.g., the content of a page). Outside the bounded episode of request/response, though, the server has no way to send information to the client, if the client hasn't initialized a request first. Nowadays the concept of *push* notifications in mobile phones or web sites has become ubiquitous, but still, the technique requires adequate software, which is not readily available. The combination of theoretical/pedagogical and technical requirements, thus, advocate the development of a comprehensive toolbox allowing researcher to customize and carry out directly their instances of the EAT according to their specific aims, minimizing the technical burden to set up a computer-mediated environment. This section provides a general overview of the toolbox, which comprises a *front-end* part dedicated to users, and a *back-end* part dedicated to researchers and practitioners. The section starts with the overview of the *back-end* part, since it is the one where the *front-end* part is defined.

### The Toolbox Back-End

The toolbox back-end is similar to a reserved admin area, where researchers must provide their credentials to access their instances of the tool. Figure \@ref(fig:toolbox-dashboard-page) shows the dashboard of the admin area available once the researcher has logged-in.

(ref:toolbox-dashboard-page-caption) The dashboard page of the admin area shows a list of active instances/studies and gives access to the different features of the back-end.

```{r toolbox-dashboard-page, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:toolbox-dashboard-page-caption)", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./figure/dew/dew-toolbox-admin-area.png"))
```

From the back-end part of the toolbox, researchers and practitioners can perform mainly four actions that have scientific and/or pedagogical relevance :

1.  Access instances of the tool, which are identified as *studies* in the interface[^1]. The dashboard only lists the active instances, but in the *studies* tab researchers can also find past or inactive instances.
2.  Create new *studies* and configure them according to the different options described in the reminder of the chapter.
3.  Access existing or create new affective spaces that can be used in *studies*. Affective spaces can be wither private, available this only to the logged-in researcher, or shared with other researchers subscribed to the same server*.*
4.  Import configurations of *studies* or affective spaces from external sources, for instance -- ideally -- supplementary material from a contribution that has used the toolbox.

### The Toolbox Front-End

## Configuration of the Expressing-Displaying Function

## Configuration of the Perceiving-Monitoring Function

Third, as illustrated in the abstract model in Section \@ref(abstract-model-of-ea) built upon the definition of emotional awareness, a multi-purpose proof of concept shall also consider computer-mediated learning environments not based on inter-personal, or not limited to dydic interactions. Computer-mediated learning enviroments span from the individual to the thousands of learners of MOOC. Ideally, a multipurpose EAT should be able to scale congruently to the context. This possibility is inherently linked with the perceiving-monitoring part of the tool. The two representations (emotion timeline and appraisal line charts) proposed by the prototype are clearly limited to a restricted number of users. Adding 20 rows of the timeline and 20 line charts to account for 20 learners would pile up an overwhelming amount of information on screen. Research and practitioners may therefore also be allowed to choose between graphical representations of emotion aligned with the number of learners sharing the same EAT, as well as the kind of emotional meaning-making that the tool is supposed to foster [@leonyProvisionAwarenessLearners2013; @derickEvaluatingEmotionVisualizations2017; @bersetVisualisationDonneesRecherche2018; @fritzRealTimeEmotionalAwareness2016].
