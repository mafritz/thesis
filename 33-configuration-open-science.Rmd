The previous chapter illustrated the parsimonious computational model linking appraisal dimensions and subjective feelings, which is the *core* of the proof of concept proposed by the thesis. This chapter introduces a toolbox built around the computational model, which allows the configuration of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) according to researchers and practitioners needs. As stated in the introduction, the implementation of a toolbox is driven by open science tenets, which advocate the need for investing in the development of open material that can foster transparency, sharing, comparison, replicability and reproducibility of research practices, measures and results [@Nosek1422; @chambersSevenDeadlySins2017; @scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020; @nelsonPsychologyRenaissance2018; @flakeMeasurementSchmeasurementQuestionable2020; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. The chapter starts by a general overview of the toolbox, which is divided in an area dedicated to researchers and practitioners, and the *end-user* interface of the tool integrated in a computer-mediated learning environment. The reminder of the Chapter then illustrates the available configuration options of how emotion is expressed-displayed and how emotion is perceived-monitored respectively. Finally, the Chapter describes some features of the toolbox that can be configured from an empirical point of view, as well as the measures that can be retrieved from the toolbox.

## General Presentation of the Toolbox

The toolbox is a web-based application that can also be installed on local machines in relatively few steps. The details are ignored here because this sort of information is likely to change over time, but the choice of a web-based application has been made to maximize ease of access to both researchers and users, with only a modern browser as a requirement. In fact, contrary to *pure* and individual self-report instruments, which may be administered in different settings with minimal adaptations, an EAT presents more challenging technical constraints, especially from a moment-to-moment and inter-personal perspective. Whenever synchronization between two or more *agents* sharing information is concerned, it is necessary to adopt a bi-directional communication technique, such as web socket. Most web applications are in fact based on the client-server architecture: the *agent* (the client) sends a request to the server, which responds back with the appropriate response (e.g., the content of a page). Outside the bounded episode of request/response, though, the server has no way to send information to the client, if the client hasn't initialized a request first. Nowadays the concept of *push* notifications in mobile phones or web sites has become ubiquitous, but still, the technique requires adequate software, which is not readily available. The combination of theoretical/pedagogical and technical requirements, thus, advocate the development of a comprehensive toolbox allowing researcher to customize and carry out directly their instances of the EAT according to their specific aims, minimizing the technical burden to set up a computer-mediated environment. This section provides a general overview of the toolbox, which comprises a *front-end* part dedicated to users, and a *back-end* part dedicated to researchers and practitioners. The section starts with the overview of the *back-end* part, since it is the one where the *front-end* part is defined.

### The Toolbox Back-End

The toolbox back-end is similar to a reserved admin area, where researchers must provide their credentials to access their instances of the tool. Figure \@ref(fig:toolbox-dashboard-page) shows the dashboard of the admin area available once the researcher has logged-in.

(ref:toolbox-dashboard-page-caption) The dashboard page of the admin area shows a list of active instances/studies and gives access to the different features of the back-end.

```{r toolbox-dashboard-page, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:toolbox-dashboard-page-caption)", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./figure/dew/dew-toolbox-admin-area.png"))
```

From the back-end part of the toolbox, researchers and practitioners can perform mainly four actions that have scientific and/or pedagogical relevance :

1.  Access instances -- that is, specific configurations of the tool -- which are identified as *studies* in the interface[^1]. The dashboard only lists the active instances, but in the *studies* tab researchers can also find past or inactive instances.
2.  Manage instances by creating, duplicating, modifying, or removing *studies*.
3.  Manage affective spaces that can be used in *studies*. Affective spaces can be either private, available thus only to the logged-in researcher, or shared with other researchers subscribed to the same server*.*
4.  Import configurations of *studies* or affective spaces from external sources, for instance -- ideally -- supplementary material from a contribution that has used the toolbox.

A *study* is the element of the toolbox that glues all parts together. It is determined by the different configurations options and is made available to users through the toolbox front-end illustrated in the next subsection. Figure @ref(fig:dew-toolbox-study-detail) shows a cropped detail page of a *study*, which happens to be an archived instance of the usability test illustrated in Chapter @ref(dew-chapter).

(ref:dew-toolbox-study-detail-caption) Example of a *study*'s detail page. The screen capture has been cropped to save space.

```{r dew-toolbox-study-detail, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:dew-toolbox-study-detail-caption)", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./figure/dew/dew-toolbox-study-details.png"))
```

Through the detail page, it is possible to perform a series of actions connected to the *study*. Only the most salient actions are listed hereafter.

First, the study can be started, which means that the front-end of the instance is launched in a new tab of the window. Each study disposes of its own web address, which can be limited to the local machine or local network, or publicly available over the web depending on where the server is installed. This is thus just one way to start-up an instance, which can nevertheless be accessed directly by users through the URL, without the need to pass from the admin area. The study can also be accessed in a preview mode, which shows how the final instance will look like to user, but without gathering any data.

Second, the *study* can be configured. The configuration is equivalent when creating a new instance or modifying an existing one. Instancescan also be duplicated, which may be useful in case of conditions within the same *study*. The configuration details are illustrated in the following sections of the chapter.

Third, the status of the study can be easily updated, switching from *open* to *closed* or vice-versa. It is in fact possible to decide whether an instance is available or not at any given time. When not available, the URL of the front-end will show a message informing the user that the instance is not active.

Fourth, it is possible to export different elements of the study. The first and more obvious element to export are the data collected. In this regard, the detail page also provides a data summary frame on the right-side of the screen, right under the main actions buttons. The data summary report the number of participants who have been used the instance, the number of observations/emotions expressed, as well as an average for every dimension rated. The recorded observations are also illustrated in a wordcloud, which provides a perceptive representation of the most frequent subjective feelings used by participants. A second element that can be exported is the affective space adopted by the *study* (see below). A third element concerns the overall configuration of the *study*, which can be shared with other interested people, for instance as supplementary material in an article. Finally, the whole *study* (data, affective space, and overall configuration combined) can be exported as a form of backup.

From the admin area it is also possible to access the list of available affective spaces, as well as create new ones. As stated above, affective spaces can be either private or shared. Only the researcher/practitioner that has created or added the affective space to the server can decide to make it public or private. When used in a *study*, the affective space is nevertheless copied into the specific instance, so that actions performed to the affective space do not automatically propagate to *studies*.

Alongside the information necessary to represent the structure of the affective space (*i.e.*, dimensions and disposition of lexicalized emotions), the toolbox also reckons the importance of crediting the original author(s) of the affective spaces. In this regard, it is possible to specify how each affective space should be cited. Figure \@ref(fig:toolbox-affective-space-detail) shows the detail page of the English version of EATMINT circumplex introduced in Section \@ref(eatmint-circumplex). The structure of the affective space can be exported either as data, with the *Export* button on the top-left side of the screen, or a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG), that is an image that can later be easily modified by a vector editor[^2]. The SVG file can later be included directly, or rasterized before inclusion in a contribution for illustrative purposes.

(ref:toolbox-affective-space-detail-caption) Detail page of the English version of the EATMINT circumplex presented in Section \@ref(eatmint-circumplex) as an example of affective space. Each affective space disposes of a field to indicate how it should be cited in order to credit the author(s).

```{r toolbox-affective-space-detail, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:toolbox-affective-space-detail-caption)", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./figure/dew/dew-toolbox-affective-space-page.png"))
```

At the time of writing, there are several affective spaces identified in the literature that can be implemented as underlying structures for the DEW. These include the EATMINT circumplex in French and English @fritzProvidingEmotionalAwareness2017, the three versions of the Geneva Emotion Wheel @schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013, the circular scaling coordinates of 28 affect words by @russellCircumplexModelAffect1980, and the mapping of 80 emotion terms on a four-dimensional space by @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016. Furthermore, as stated in the description of the computational model in the previous chapter, an higher-order dimensional space can also be used for lower-order rating dimensions. For instance, a three-dimensional affective space can be (1) disjointed in three different one-dimensional affective space, (2) combined in two different bi-dimensional affective space, or (3) used in its whole three-dimensional structure. Bi-dimensional affective spaces can also be represented both as a circumplex or as a Cartesian plane, allowing thus great flexibility on the underlying *reference frame* to be adopted.

Finally, the last relevant feature from a scientific or pedagogical perspective concerns the possibility to import affective spaces and whole *studies*' configurations. As mentioned above, this is meant to increase the transparency and sharing of research and practices involving the use of the tool. External sources can be imported for direct use, for better understanding of the inner functioning of an instance, as well as for checking the accuracy and adherence to protocols.

To sum up, the back-end area of the toolbox is meant to facilitate researchers and practitioners tasks both at the individual and collective levels. At the same time, there is also the possibility to use the tool in isolation, on individual premises, with relatively few technical steps and requirements.

### The Toolbox Front-End

The toolbox front-end is the instance of the tool participants/learners will interact with. It is available through an URL as any other site or web application. The front-end part of the screen can count up to four different screens: (1) one for general instructions, (2) one for the log-in/synchronization with two or more users if needed, (3) one for the task itself, and (4) one for a debriefing or end-of-task screen that can for instance provide a link to further steps in the procedure. There are nevertheless ways to modify the URL given to users, for them to skip any step except the task itself. For instance, users can be provided with an URL that includes a specific or random ID and that logs users directly into the task. This mechanism has been used in the empirical contribution of Chapter \@ref(study-2).

When two or more participants have to be synchronized to start a specific task, the toolbox provide a *pseudo* log-in system that can be configured to hold-on until all the required users are ready to start the task. Figure ... illustrates this passage. The same instance can be used for as many groups as needed, with the size of the group that can potentially scale up to thousands. The limit is in fact determined by the machine's ability to deal with concurrent sockets. Users belonging to the same group need only to provide a common Group ID. Once again, the instructions on how to log-in into the system can be customized. Synchronization is also not mandatory. For instance, in a longitudinal use of the EAT as the one that will be made in the second empirical contribution of the tool, participants could log-in at any time, regardless of the number of concurrent colleagues connected on the interface. The system automatically detects if a new (or returning) user has accessed the instance and adapts the interface accordingly.

(ref:dew-toolbox-frontend-login-caption) Example of *log-in* screen when the task has to start at the same time for all involved users. This is nevertheless not a mandatory step.

```{r dew-toolbox-frontend-login, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:dew-toolbox-frontend-login-caption)", out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./figure/dew/dew-toolbox-frontend-login.png"))
```

The core of the front-end is the interface where the EAT is available, which can be coupled (or not) with a task or learning activity on the side. Figure \@ref(fig:toolbox-frontend-interface) shows the front-end interface of an hypothetical study or learning activity based on collaborative writing. The EAT occupies the left-hand side of the screen, whereas the online editor is in a iframe (technically a window inside a window) on the right-hand side. The interface also presents a timer and a button that allows participants to stop the task at any time. This is just an example of how the choice of a web-based application allows the integration with existing tools, but once again, the possibilities are much wider and depends on the specific aims for which the toolbox is adopted. As will be described in the reminder of the Chapter, many aspects of the overall interface and the inner functions can be adapted through the back-end part of the toolbox. The example, for instance, adopts an *Energy* x *Familiarity* dimensions, which are derived from the *Arousal* x *Novelty* dimensions of the four-dimensional structure in @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016.

(ref:toolbox-frontend-interface-caption) Example of an instance of the toolbox comprising the EAT on the left-hand side and a collaborative writing task on the right-hand side.

```{r toolbox-frontend-interface, fig.align="top", fig.cap="(ref:toolbox-frontend-interface-caption)", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here("./figure/dew/dew-toolbox-frontend-task.png")
)
```

To sum-up, the front-end of the toolbox consists in a web-application to which most users should be nowadays familiar with. The overall interface reflects the choices of the researcher or practitioner made on the back-end. Some of the most salient choices are briefly outlines in the reminder of the chapter.

## Configuration of the Expressing-Displaying Function

## Configuration of the Perceiving-Monitoring Function

Third, as illustrated in the abstract model in Section \@ref(abstract-model-of-ea) built upon the definition of emotional awareness, a multi-purpose proof of concept shall also consider computer-mediated learning environments not based on inter-personal, or not limited to dydic interactions. Computer-mediated learning enviroments span from the individual to the thousands of learners of MOOC. Ideally, a multipurpose EAT should be able to scale congruently to the context. This possibility is inherently linked with the perceiving-monitoring part of the tool. The two representations (emotion timeline and appraisal line charts) proposed by the prototype are clearly limited to a restricted number of users. Adding 20 rows of the timeline and 20 line charts to account for 20 learners would pile up an overwhelming amount of information on screen. Research and practitioners may therefore also be allowed to choose between graphical representations of emotion aligned with the number of learners sharing the same EAT, as well as the kind of emotional meaning-making that the tool is supposed to foster [@leonyProvisionAwarenessLearners2013; @derickEvaluatingEmotionVisualizations2017; @bersetVisualisationDonneesRecherche2018; @fritzRealTimeEmotionalAwareness2016].
