# General Theoretical Background

The implementation and assessment of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) in distance learning covers a wide spectrum of theories, pertaining often to multi- or inter-disciplinary fields. A comprehensive review of all the relevant literature is therefore beyond the scope and reach of the thesis. The general theoretical background will thus be preeminently tailored around the three elements that compose the acronym EAT: Emotion, Awareness and Tool. 

First, an EAT targets an *emotion* as the affective phenomenon of interest. It is therefore necessary to define what an emotion is, as well as mechanisms determining -- at the intra- and inter-personal levels -- causes and consequences of emotions, in particular with respect to learning processes. The section about emotion will mainly draw information from psychological theories of emotions, as well as contributions targeting the interplay between affective states and learning.

Second, an EAT is supposed to provide *awareness* to its users. Awareness is a multi-faceted concepts, which can be roughly mapped to two distinct -- but possibly intertwined -- phenomenon. On the one hand, intra-personal awareness: the mechanism by which a person becomes aware of something. On the other hand, inter-personal awareness, that is, the perception, processing and use of information about others. The section about awareness will focus mainly on the latter, drawing from the literature about the importance and instrumentality of information about others in a computer-mediated environments, which requires alternative channels of communication with respect to face-to-face conditions. 

Third, an EAT is a *tool*, that is, a computational and information system implemented in a technology enhanced environment. It must therefore resolve, for instance, what kind of entities are targeted as input, when and how they are inserted into the system, as well as how and when these entities are then mapped to corresponding outputs, with various possible degrees of processing in between. The more technical section of the theoretical framework will mainly draw from the literature about affective systems -- such as affect-aware or emotion-aware systems -- implemented in learning environments. 

The theoretical framework will also consider some pivotal aspects of distance learning, especially in terms of learners' needs. Even though there is a growing consensus in considering that the frontiers between distance and co-located education are progressively falling apart, there is also ample evidence for the need to adapt the instructional design according to the conditions in which learning processes take place. The cognitive, social, and affective determinants of learning are situated and interact with the environment. As a consequence, there are fundamental differences whether learners' share both, either, or none of the spatial and temporal coordinates. 

Finally, the chapter will illustrate and discuss some key contributions in the literature, which have investigated emotional awareness with theoretical, methodological, or instrumental perspectives that are relevant to the thesis. These contributions will be referred to -- by comparison and contrast -- in the empirical chapters of the thesis, and it is therefore worth illustrating them at length. 

## Emotion

### What Is An Emotion?

*What is an emotion?* is a question that appears as a label in various types of contributions related to emotions. Foremost, it is the title of a seminal article by William James [-@jamesWhatEmotion1884], which, despite being more than a century old, is still source of lively debate [@ellsworthWilliamJamesEmotion1994; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. There are many iconic statements that testify to the difficulty of studying emotions from a scientific perspective. Fehr and Russel [-@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984, p. 464] argued that "[e]veryone knows what an emotion is, until asked to give a definition", which resonates with Kleinginna and Kleinginna [-@kleinginnaCategorizedListEmotion1981], who, around the same time forty years ago, collected almost one hundred definitions. More recently, Frijda and Scherer [@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009, p. 142] still confirmed that "emotion may be one of the fuzziest concepts in all of the sciences", which has nevertheless not stopped scholars to study it from different -- sometimes converging, oftentimes diverging -- perspectives [for a recent overview, see among others @adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @deonnaEmotionsPhilosophicalIntroduction2012; @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003; @foxNatureEmotionFundamental2018; @oatleyEmotionsBriefHistory2004; @plamperHistoryEmotionsIntroduction2015; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018]. On the contrary, and possibly as a consequence, within the social sciences alone, the number of publications with the keyword *emotion* has annually multiplied by a factor of 1.13 between 1990 and 2011 [@schererHumanEmotionExperiences2013].

Issues about the definition of emotion are rooted in historical, cultural and epistemological differences, within and across disciplines and approaches -- see for example @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003 and @plamperHistoryEmotionsIntroduction2015 for overarching perspectives, or @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013 for a more concise introduction. Some of the broader controversies regarding emotion can be organized at various levels, such as (a) the relationship and differentiation between emotion and other phenomena of the mind such as consciousness or various forms of cognition [@broschImpactEmotionPerception2013; @leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987; @liebermanBooConsciousnessProblem2019; @rollsEmotionDecisionmakingExplained2014]; (b) the relationship and differentiation between emotion and other affect-related phenomena such as moods, preferences, attitudes, motivation, desires, feelings, sentiments, passions, and so on [@linnenbrink-garciaAdaptiveMotivationEmotion2016; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003]; and (c) the relationship and differentiation within phenomena that are considered manifestation of emotion, such as *anger*, *fear*, *happiness*, and the like [@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984; @fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003]. The implementation of an EAT, especially one that has a multipurpose vocation, must therefore face the complexity of defining the *unit* that it aims to make people aware of [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007]. Rather then providing a comprehensive review of definitions or controversies, though, this section unfolds a series of criteria that are relevant both to emotion definition and decisions to be taken in implementing an EAT.

A first, broad decision that shall be considered can be related to what Scarantino and de Sousa [-@sep-emotion] identify as the two *desiderata* of emotion definition. The first consists in shaping the definition of emotion in order to achieve compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage, which corresponds to a descriptive definition. The second aims at finding a definition of emotion that is theoretically fruitful, that is, a prescriptive definition. The two desiderata are not mutually exclusive, since even a prescriptive definition should try to maintain as much compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage as possible. But, in the case of incompatibility with ordinary intuition, a prescriptive definition should favor theoretical generalization. Roughly translated in more concrete terms, a definition of emotion should guide the implementation of an EAT in deciding whether it shall convey what users consider an emotion to be from a *folk* perspective, or rather what an emotion should be considered according to a *scientific* perspective [@scarantinoHowDefineEmotions2012]. 

From a pure usability standpoint, that is, the perspective of a learner that must face a tool she is not used to have in a learning environment, a *folk* perspective should not be discarded as simplistic. For instance, an EAT could be based on the most frequent affective states encountered by learners [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013a; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018a], without any relationship with a prescriptive definition, and regardless of whether they are more or less prototypical of emotion according to theory. For instance, in a selective meta-analysis conducted by D'Mello [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013] on the relative incidence of discrete affective states during learning with technology, the author identifies the following affective states as more frequent: engagement/flow, boredom, confusion, curiosity, happiness, and frustration. 

In the meantime, from a multipurpose point of view, which is in and on itself a form of generalization, the link with a *scientific*, theory-driven perspective maximizes the chances of taking full advantage of emotional awareness.
