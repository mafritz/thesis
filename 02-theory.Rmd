There is a growing consensus in the broader education research, including education psychology, in considering learning as the results of cognitive, social, and affective interactions [@bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003; @naykkiSocioemotionalConflictCollaborative2014; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005]. The interplay between two complex and multifaceted concepts as *emotion* and *learning* inevitably leads, exponentially, to further complexity. Both emotion and learning, in fact, *happen* at overlapping and interacting levels, ranging from the *micro-level* of neurophysiological substrates of the brain to the *macro-level* of instructional designs and education systems that take into account -- or otherwise ignore -- learners' emotions. A thorough overview of the multitude of scenarios in which emotion and learning can interact is far beyond the scope of this contribution [for recent and overarching perspectives see for instance @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014].

## Emotional Awareness from Psychological Perspective

### Intra-Personal Functions of Emotion

This subsection presents a set of theories that confer to emotion specific intra-personal functions, which, even if not directly related or inspired by the Component Process Model (CPM) theoretical framework introduced in the previous subsection, can be integrated, to some extent, or constrasted with the general underlying mechanism or specific components of the CPM. As stated in the introduction, an effort is made to maintain authors' original labeling of affect phenomena. For this reason, different terms may occasionally refer to something equivalent or nearly equivalent in the CPM, or, conversely, the same label may refer to a concept that in the CPM is labeled differently. Two functions are presented hereafter: *intrinsic* emotion regulation and *intrinsic* affect labeling. The *intrinsic* prefix is added to differentiate from similar functions that are presented at the inter-personal level in the next subsection, but is then dropped in most of the text.

#### Intrinsic Emotion Regulation

*Regulation* more broadly, and *emotion regulation* more specifically are concepts often adopted in the literature in general, and also in learning and education (more on this later, but see for instance @hoffmannTeachingEmotionRegulation2020; @jarvenojaEmotionControlCollaborative2009; @jarvenojaRegulationEmotionsSocially2013; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020). 


#### Instrinsic Affect Labeling

### Inter-Personal Functions of Emotion

#### Overarching Social Functions of Emotion

The social and cultural function of emotion may therefore have been built upon a *feature* that has evolved particularly in some species, such as human beings, for which inter-personal relations are pivotal to survival and, less dramatically, well-being [@parkinsonEmotionSocialRelations2005; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999]. Keltner and Haidt [-@keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999] identify four level of analysis in which emotion play a social function: (1) the individual level, whenever the source of the emotion is of a social nature -- which, for some scholars, means most if not all of the time [@fischerWhereHaveAll2010; @parkinsonEmotionsAreSocial1996; @rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009]; (2) the dyadic level, such as in direct dialogue or collaboration; (3) the group-level, in which people share a common identities and goals to attain; and (4) the cultural level, where the analysis focus on macro-elements such as history and tradition. A recent overarching synthesis on the social function of emotions across all levels proposed by Fischer and Manstead [-@fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016] identifies two complementary, but distinct, functions performed by emotions: affiliation, and distancing. The affiliation function serves to form and maintain positive social relationship with others, whereas the distancing function helps in establishing and maintaining a social position relative to others. Other social functions of emotions, further developed below in the chapter, comprise the spontaneous tendency of people to share their emotions with others [@rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005], the use of emotional information to better understand behavior and appropriate conduct in social situations [@parkinsonEmotionsInterpersonalInteractions2010; @vankleefHowEmotionsRegulate2009], or situation in which people voluntary attempt to act upon emotions in others [@netzerInterpersonalInstrumentalEmotion2015; @reeckSocialRegulationEmotion2016; @zakiInterpersonalEmotionRegulation2013].

## Emotional Awareness From the Affective Computing Perspective

As stated in the introduction, and EAT technically combines features of awareness tools, illustrated in the previous section, and of affective systems -- such as affect-aware or emotion-aware systems -- which are here broadly defined as computation and information systems, which explicitly target affective phenomena [@calvoFrontiersAffectAwareLearning2012; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @picardAffectiveComputing2000]. This section will gather both theoretical and applied contributions about affective systems, particularly in technology enhanced learning environments. This will provide the opportunity to relate, by comparison and contrasts, the implementation of an EAT as a technological artifact targeting affective phenomena, and emotion more particularly. 

### The Interactional Approach to Affective Computing

A first step in the process to position an EAT with respect to affective systems is to turn to the broad and relatively recent field named *affective computing* which refers to "computing
that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotions" [@picardAffectiveComputing2000, p. 3]. Picard^[Picard was the first to introduce the term *affective computing* and her experience is telling of how the study of emotion and affective computing more specifically have changed over the last few decades. In the introduction of her seminal book *Affective Computing*, Picard [-@picardAffectiveComputing2000] -- also cited in @boehnerHowEmotionMade2007, from which the idea to include this passage is taken, see below -- writes: "I never expected to write a book addressing emotions. My education has been dominated by science and engineering, and based on
axioms, laws, equations, rational thinking, and a pride that shuns the ‘touchy-feely.’ Being a woman in a field containing mostly men has provided extra incentive to cast off the stereotype of ‘emotional female’ in favor of the logical behavior of a scholar".] [-@picardAffectiveComputing2009] identifies four, non mutually exclusive, research areas:

1. Technologies for sensing, recognizing, modeling, and predicting emotional and affective states;
2. Methods for computers to respond intelligently and respectfully to handle perceived affective information;
3. Technology for displaying emotional information or mediating the expression or communication of emotion; 
4. Computational mechanisms that stimulate internal emotions or implement their regulatory and biasing functions.

At first blush, the third research area stands out as the best match for an EAT. The description perfectly fits with the main purpose of an EAT, which resonates with all the features proposed by the description: it aims at displaying emotional information, *and* mediate the expression *and* communication of emotion. According to Boehner and colleagues [-@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007], though, this particular line of research has been neglected in affective computing, whose mainstream approach considers emotion as an internal and individual phenomenon. The authors identify this mainstream approach to emotion as *informational*, "rooted in a longer laboratory-science tradition of studying emotion in which subjective experience is considered suspect, to be replaced by objective measures" [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007, p. 276]. The authors advocate instead an *interactional* approach, which (1) focus on how computers can help users understand their emotions, rather than how computers can understand users’ emotions; and (2) sees emotions as a cultural, dynamic and social phenomena, constructed in action and interaction. The position taken by Boehener and colleagues is very-well resumed by this passage that is worth citing at length, for it targets perfectly the main aim of an EAT (*ibid*):

> The role of affective systems is not to transmit pre-existing emotional units, but to provide a resource for emotional meaning-making. Success of such a system is measured by whether users find the system’s responses useful for interpreting, reflecting on, and experiencing their emotions. Evaluation does not aim at finding a user’s original, *true* emotions, but in tracking
how emotions are constructed and interpreted over time, and correlating these dynamics with
aspects of system design. (p. 287, the use of italic here replaces the quotation marks in the original article)

In support of this claim, the article (*ibid.*) illustrates and compare different affective systems that have either an *informatinal* or *interactional* approach. For instance, one *interactional* system pertained precisely to the notion of emotional awareness. Co-workers in a shared space were asked to fill a survey about their emotions in real-time and, according to their responses, an abstract painting projected on a wall changed background color, the number and cluster of dots, and the speed of movement in the animation as a function of aggregates and averages of the survey responses. The authors report that co-workers were puzzled by the abstract representation, which contributed in fostering the co-construction of emotional meaning-making advocated in the *interactional* approach.

One can at this point argue whether Bohener and colleagues would consider emotion as defined by the CPM approach as a pre-existing emotional unit, pertaining thus more on the laboratory-driven and *informational* approach. The answer seems to lie directly in the article itself (*ibid*, p. 277), where the authors cite Scherer's work as falling outside the pure *informational* approach, since the CPM also consider subjective feeling as an integral part of the model. An *interactional* approach does not seem, thus, to be incompatible with a CPM-driven approach. Bohener and colleagues' statement is thus retained as a perfect representation of the overall aim of an EAT, which thus fits perfectly with one of the research areas in affective computing.

### Computational Models of Emotions

A second element where affective computing may guide the implementation of an EAT is represented by computational models of emotion.

### Taxonomies of Affective Systems in Learning Environments

An EAT combines features of an awareness tool with that of affective systems, such as affect-aware or emotion-aware technologies, through which affective information is integrated into the technology enhanced learning environment [for a recent overview see among others @arguedasOntologyEmotionAwareness2015; @calvoFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @calvoFrontiersAffectAwareLearning2012; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @grawemeyerAffectiveLearningImproving2017; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015]. Such systems, though, may vary greatly in their features and objectives, for instance with respect to how they conceptualize affect and what affective dynamics they aim to enhance in the learning process.

From an affective standpoint, affective systems can be categorized according to the four area of research in affective computing proposed by Picard [-@picardAffectiveComputing2009] and illustrated above. Furthermore, affective systems may focus on one or more phenomena within the affective spectrum, such as preferences, dispositions, moods or emotions [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. Finally, they can target one or more processes within the same affective phenomenon such as elicitation, recognition, understanding, communication or regulation [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007; @derksRoleEmotionComputermediated2008; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008; @grossEmotionRegulationCurrent2015; @reeckSocialRegulationEmotion2016; @schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; @schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007; @schlegelEmotionRecognitionUnidimensional2012; @siemerSameSituationdifferentEmotions2007].

From the point of view of the learning process, affective systems can be oriented -- exclusively, primarily or equally -- towards the learner's individual affective states, the collective affective states of a group sharing common learning processes and outcomes, the affective states of teachers, or even the affective states of computerized agents implemented into the system, such as embodied tutors [@cerneaGroupAffectiveTone2014; @craigEmoteAloudLearning2008; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; ; @leeTeachersEmotionsEmotion2016; @mantySocioemotionalInteractionCollaborative2020; @naykkiSocioemotionalConflictCollaborative2014]. The aim of the affective system may also be inherently linked to the subject at hand, such as support in a computer science course, or overtly concerned with the acquisition of affect-related skills such as social and emotional learning [@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @osherAdvancingSciencePractice2016], emotional competence [@schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007; @schlegelGenevaEmotionalCompetence2018], emotional intelligence [@chernissEmotionalIntelligenceClarification2010; @hodzicHowEfficientAre2018; @nathansonCreatingEmotionallyIntelligent2016; @saloveyEmotionalIntelligence1990; @mayerAbilityModelEmotional2016], or emotion self- or social-regulation [@hoffmannTeachingEmotionRegulation2020; @jarvenojaEmotionControlCollaborative2009; @jarvenojaRegulationEmotionsSocially2013].

The interest for affective systems in technology enhanced learning environments has recently pushed some scholars to attempt comparative assessment and the extraction of common features in order to determine possible taxonomies [@calvoFeelingThinkingComputing2015; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @harleyDevelopingEmotionAwareAdvanced2017; @harleyMeasuringEmotionsSurvey2015]. Rather than directly provide an arbitrary list of affective systems that may have, to various degrees, some degrees of similitude with an EAT, this subsection builds upon the effort of these overarching contributions to identify how an EAT fits in.
