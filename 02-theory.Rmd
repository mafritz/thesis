The implementation and assessment of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) in distance learning covers a wide spectrum of theories, pertaining often to multi- or inter-disciplinary fields. A comprehensive review of all the relevant literature is therefore beyond the scope of the thesis. The general theoretical background will thus be preeminently tailored according to the following main assumption: an EAT combines features of awareness tools and of affective systems to provide learners with instrumental information conveyed through emotion. The chapter will thus be organized as follows.

First, an EAT targets an *emotion* as the affective phenomenon at hand. It is therefore necessary to define what an emotion is, as well as mechanisms determining -- at the intra- and inter-personal levels -- causes and consequences of emotions, in particular with respect to learning processes. The section about emotion will mainly draw information from two integrated theoretical frameworks: the Component Process Model [@sanderAppraisalDrivenComponentialApproach2018; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005] and the Emotion As Social Information [@vankleefEmergingViewEmotion2010; @vankleefHowEmotionsRegulate2009; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018]. The section will also proposes an overview of the extant literature linking emotion with learning and education, and to what extent current trends about this subject can be integrated with the two theoretical frameworks.

Second, an EAT is supposed to provide *awareness* to its users in two distinct,but often intertwined, ways. On the one hand, through self-awareness: the mechanism by which a person becomes aware of something. On the other hand, through group-awareness, that is, the perception, processing and use of information about others. The section about awareness will focus mainly on the latter, drawing from the literature about the importance and instrumentality of information about others in a computer-mediated environment, which requires alternative channels of communication with respect to face-to-face conditions.

Third, an EAT is also a form of affective system, that is, a computational and information system that models affective phenomena at various levels of abstraction and to different purposes. It must therefore resolve, for instance, what kind of entities are targeted as input, when and how they are inserted into the system, as well as how and when these entities are then mapped to corresponding outputs, with various possible degrees of processing in between. The more technical section of the theoretical framework will mainly draw from the literature about affective systems -- such as affect-aware or emotion-aware systems -- implemented in learning environments, especially from a human-computer interaction perspective.

The theoretical framework will also consider some pivotal aspects of distance learning, especially in terms of learners' needs. Even though there is a growing consensus in considering that the frontiers between distance and co-located education are progressively falling apart, there is also substantial evidence about the need to adapt the instructional design according to the conditions in which learning processes take place. The cognitive, social, and affective determinants of learning are situated and interact with the environment. As a consequence, there are fundamental differences whether learners' share both, either, or none of the spatial and temporal coordinates.

Finally, the chapter will illustrate and discuss some key contributions in the literature, which have investigated emotional awareness with theoretical, methodological, or instrumental perspectives that are relevant to the thesis's objectives. These contributions will be referred to -- by comparison and contrast -- in the empirical chapters of the thesis, and it is therefore worth illustrating them at length.

## Emotion

This section focus on the multifaceted and controversial concept commonly referred to as *emotion*, as well as the pivotal role that emotion play in different phenomena implicated in (distance) learning processes, both at the intra- and inter-persona levels. The aim of this section is threefold. First, it provides an organized overview of the interplay between emotion and learning or education as a means to justify the pertinence of taking emotion into account during distance learning. Second, it emphasizes how the implementation of a multipurpose EAT must face decisions that are tightly coupled with the way emotion is defined by emotion theories. Third, it motivates the selection among extant theories of the *most suitable* candidates for a theory-driven EAT. In the absence of established and cumulative evidence on the subject at hand, the justification is, to some extent, arbitrary. It is therefore crucial that the degrees of freedom in this selection shall be, as much as possible, reduced and explicit.

There is a growing consensus in the broader education research, including education psychology, in considering learning as the results of cognitive, social, and affective interactions [@bakerAffectiveLearningTogether2013; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003; @naykkiSocioemotionalConflictCollaborative2014; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005]. The interplay between two complex and multifaceted concepts as *emotion* and *learning* inevitably leads, exponentially, to further complexity. Both emotion and learning, in fact, *happen* at overlapping and interacting levels, ranging from the *micro-level* of neurophysiological substrates of the brain to the *macro-level* of instructional designs and education systems that take into account -- or otherwise ignore -- learners' emotions. A thorough overview of the multitude of scenarios in which emotion and learning can interact is far beyond the scope of this contribution [for recent and overarching perspectives see for instance @brackettPermissionFeelUnlocking2019; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014].

### What Is an Emotion?

*What is an emotion?* is a question that literally appears in a multitude of scientific contributions. For instance, it is the title of a seminal article by William James [-@jamesWhatEmotion1884], which, despite being more than a century old, is still source of lively debate [@ellsworthWilliamJamesEmotion1994; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. There are many iconic statements that testify to the difficulty of studying emotions from a scientific perspective. Fehr and Russel [-@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984, p. 464] argued that "[e]veryone knows what an emotion is, until asked to give a definition", which resonates with Kleinginna and Kleinginna [-@kleinginnaCategorizedListEmotion1981], who, around the same time forty years ago, collected almost one hundred definitions. More recently, Frijda and Scherer [-@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009, p. 142] still confirmed that "emotion may be one of the fuzziest concepts in all of the sciences", which was empirically corroborated by Izard [-@izardManyMeaningsAspects2010], who attempted -- and failed -- to extrapolate a unitary definition from the responses of 35 leading researchers from different fields to 6 questions about emotion definition, function, activation and regulation. The uncertainty and flexibility in defining emotion has nevertheless not stopped scholars to study it from different -- sometimes converging, oftentimes diverging -- perspectives [for a recent overview from different disciplines, see among others @adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @deonnaEmotionsPhilosophicalIntroduction2012; @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003; @foxNatureEmotionFundamental2018; @oatleyEmotionsBriefHistory2004; @plamperHistoryEmotionsIntroduction2015; @pekrunEmotionsSchool2018; @schererBlueprintAffectiveComputing2010]. On the contrary, and possibly as a consequence, within the social sciences alone, the number of publications with the keyword *emotion* has annually multiplied by a factor of 1.13 between 1990 and 2011 [@schererHumanEmotionExperiences2013]. According to an estimation of Izard, at around the same period [@izardManyMeaningsAspects2010] 2'732 articles about emotion were published in the first decade of the millennium.

Issues about the definition of emotion are rooted in historical, cultural and epistemological differences, within and across disciplines and approaches -- see @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003 and @plamperHistoryEmotionsIntroduction2015 for overarching perspectives, or @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013 for a more concise introduction. Some of the broader controversies regarding emotion can be encapsulated in onion layers that are highly interconnected and mutually influenced in both directions. From the outset to the inset, controversies may in fact concern:

-   how emotion relates to, and differ from other phenomenon of the mind/body such as intelligence, rationality, consciousness or various forms of cognition [@broschImpactEmotionPerception2013; @leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987; @liebermanBooConsciousnessProblem2019; @rollsEmotionDecisionmakingExplained2014; @becharaRoleEmotionDecisionmaking2004; @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013; @murphyIntelligenceInterpersonalSensitivity2011; @saloveyEmotionalIntelligence1990];
-   how emotion relates to, and differ from other affective phenomena such as moods, preferences, attitudes, motivation, desires, feelings, sentiments, passions, and so on [@linnenbrink-garciaAdaptiveMotivationEmotion2016; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003; @schwarz2003mood; @colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014];
-   whether there are, and what are the building blocks and features, covering the all process from causation to consequenes, shared by all phenomena identified as emotion [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @moorsTheoriesEmotionCausation2009; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985];
-   whether there are a countable number of, and how to distinguish between discrete emotions -- such as *anger*, *fear*, or *happiness* -- and if it possible to categorize them in taxonomies [@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984; @fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @scarantinoDonGiveBasic2011; @ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992]
-   assuming that a discrete emotion exists, how can it be referred to -- both from an everyday communication and scientific conceptualization points of view -- considering differences between cultures and languages? [@ekmanWhatMeantCalling2011; @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @torrePuttingFeelingsWords2018; @grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008; @schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013; @douglas-cowieEmotionalSpeechNew2003].

The implementation of an EAT, especially one that has a multipurpose vocation, must therefore face the complexity of defining the *unit* that it aims to make people aware of [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007]. In this regard, a first, broad decision that shall be considered can be related to what Scarantino and de Sousa [-@sep-emotion] identify as the two *desiderata* of emotion definition. The first consists in shaping the definition of emotion in order to achieve compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage, which corresponds to a descriptive definition. The second aims at finding a definition of emotion that is theoretically fruitful, that is, a prescriptive definition. The two desiderata are not mutually exclusive, since even a prescriptive definition should try to maintain as much compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage as possible [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. But, in the case of incompatibility with ordinary intuition, a prescriptive definition should favor theoretical generalization [@scarantinoHowDefineEmotions2012]. Roughly translated in more concrete terms, a definition of emotion should guide the implementation of an EAT in deciding whether it shall convey what users consider an emotion to be from a *folk* perspective, or rather what an emotion should be considered according to a *scientific* perspective [@scarantinoHowDefineEmotions2012; @fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005].

From a pure usability standpoint, that is, the perspective of a learner that must face a tool she is not used to have in a learning environment, a *folk* perspective should not be discarded as simplistic. For instance, an EAT could be based on the most frequent affective states encountered by learners [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018], without any relationship with a prescriptive definition, and regardless of whether these states are more or less prototypical of emotion [@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984; @scarantinoDonGiveBasic2011]. For instance, in a selective meta-analysis conducted by D'Mello [-@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013] on the relative incidence of discrete affective states during learning with technology, the author identifies the following as more frequent: engagement/flow, boredom, confusion, curiosity, happiness, and frustration. Even more bluntly, an EAT could avoid the problem altogether by prompting users to share *what they think an emotion is*, letting them construe the meaning of how they feel without any guidance [@barrettKnowingWhatYou2001; @barrettSolvingEmotionParadox2006; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003]. On the other hand, from a multipurpose point of view -- which is in and on itself a form of generalization -- the link with a *scientific*, theory-driven perspective presents several advantages.

First, by mapping the tool to a prescriptive definition, emotion not only emerges according to what it *is*, but also according to what it *does* and why. There is a growing body of literature focusing on the functional role emotion plays both at the intra- and inter-personal levels [more on this later, but see for instance @adolphsInvestigatingEmotionsFunctional2018; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999; @levensonIntrapersonalFunctionsEmotion1999; @leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987]. Thus, a theory-driven perspective may contribute to better assemble these functions and take full advantage of them in the implementation of the EAT [@broschAppraisingBrainNeuroCognitive2013; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018].

Second, tailoring an EAT on emotion theory may contribute to guide learners in discovering and using it, since they can be both interested and reassured by identifying underlying mechanisms that are thought to be an integral part of the phenomenon [more on this in the next chapter, but see for instance @tranEmotionsDecisionMakingProcesses2012 for an applied example]. As it will be shown in more details in the section about awareness tools below, the fact that a dedicated tool is provided in the environment for some *corollary* activities does not automatically mean that it will be adopted [@kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003].

Third, from a research perspective, linking the EAT to a theory facilitates the assessment and comparison of measures collected through or about it, and therefore foster common ground in the contributions that shall decide to adopt it [@izardManyMeaningsAspects2010; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. In the meantime, the EAT would also benefit from the upcoming theoretical and applied contributions in the literature that relate to the shared emotion theory, ensuring the tool can progress over time, or otherwise be dismissed if some competing theory shall provide a better alternative [@fergusonVastGraveyardUndead2012; @meehlAppraisingAmendingTheories1990].

These reasons, thus, advocate the adoption of a theory-driven approach to emotion definition. The next subsection will address the topic of emotion theories.

### Theories of Emotion

As one may expect from the complexity in defining an emotion outlined in the previous subsection, there are a multitude of emotion theories and taxonomies that try to categorize them [for a recent overview, see @moorsTheoriesEmotionCausation2009; @sep-emotion; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013]. Adopting a perspective spanning philosophy and affective sciences, Scarantino and de Sousa [-@sep-emotion] identify three traditions in which most of emotion theories can be divided in: (1) the Feeling Tradition, which considers the conscious experience of an emotion as the fundamental characteristic; (2) the Evaluative Tradition, which focuses on how emotion consists in, or is crucially defined by the way eliciting stimuli are evaluated; and (3) the Motivational Tradition, which identifies emotion with specific internal states driven by want or need to satisfy a goal.

In psychology, the last decades have been characterized mainly by three major families of emotion theories that account for the *whole* emotional phenomenon, from causes to consequences, and not only part of it, such as emotion regulation [@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013] : (1) basic emotion theories [@ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992; @ekmanWhatMeantCalling2011; @huttoNewBetterBET2018; @keltnerEmotionalExpressionAdvances2019], (2) constructivist/dimensional emotion theories [@russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @russellEmotionCoreAffect2009; @stanleyTwodimensionalAffectiveSpace2009], and (3) appraisal emotion theories [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985]. These three families emerged from different historical backgrounds, and the foundation are often rooted in philosophical perspectives with secular traditions. In *psychological* era, we can trace back seminal work on the three families in the second half of the last century [@arnoldEmotionPersonalityPsychological1960; @lazarusPsychologicalStressCoping1966; @russellCircumplexModelAffect1980; @schererEmotionProcessFunction1982]. Since then, theories have influenced each other over the years, converging on some points, and remaining distinct on others [@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013]. New -- often interdisciplinary -- theories that have emerged lately resume and extends some ideas of one, or often more, of those families, as in the *enacting* approach proposed by Colombetti [-@colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014] or the *theory of affective pragmatics* proposed by Scarantino [-@scarantinoHowThingsEmotional2017]. In other cases, such as in the *theory of constructed emotion* advocated by Feldman Barrett [@barrettHowEmotionsAre2018; @barrettSolvingEmotionParadox2006; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017], there is considerable discontinuity with previous work,challenging the principle according to which emotions are responses or exist as natural kinds. For instance, Feldman Barret [-@barrettHowEmotionsAre2018, p. vii-viii] argues that "[e]motion are real, but not in the objective sense that molecules or neurons are real. They are real in the same sense that money is real -- that is, hardly an illusion, but a product of human agreement". 

Within this scattered framework, it is difficult to fully account for the choice of a theory, since a thorough comparison of all the different theories within and across families is far beyond the scope and reach of this contribution. One can nevertheless at least make clear what theory or theories are taken into consideration, even at the risk of some ambiguity in the reasons behind these choices [@izardManyMeaningsAspects2010; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. Even if only partially satisfactory, that seems to be at least a step forward considering recent evidence suggesting that only around one article out of four published between 2009 and 2019 in psychology clearly refer to a unambiguously stated theoretical framework [@mcphetresDecadeTheoryReflected2021]. In this regard, the next section will illustrate the Component Process Model [@sanderAppraisalDrivenComponentialApproach2018; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005] and the Emotion As Social Information [@vankleefEmergingViewEmotion2010; @vankleefHowEmotionsRegulate2009; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018] theoretical frameworks. The first mainly account for the intra-personal function of emotion, whereas the second for the inter-personal function. Some of the reasons behind these choices will become clearer as the framework are illustrated and related to the subject at hand, whereas others derive from the fact that the overall thesis is a *spin-off* from a project that has already adopted these frameworks, even though to a lesser extent, and it was therefore straightforward to build on previous knowledge. The multipurpose vocation of the EAT, which will be revealed in more concrete terms in the next chapters, allow nevertheless the tool to implement elements from other theories, in particular constructivist/dimensional theories. Relevant theoretical information will nevertheless be illustrated punctually when directly applied rather than centralized in this chapter.

### The Component Process Model Theoretical Framework



### Intra-Personal Functions of Emotion

### The Emotion As Social Information Theoretical Framework

### Inter-Personal Functions of Emotion

#### Social Functions of Emotion

The social and cultural function of emotion may therefore have been built upon a *feature* that has evolved particularly in some species, such as human beings, for which inter-personal relations are pivotal to survival and, less dramatically, well-being [@parkinsonEmotionSocialRelations2005; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999]. Keltner and Haidt [-@keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999] identify four level of analysis in which emotion play a social function: (1) the individual level, whenever the source of the emotion is of a social nature -- which, for some scholars, means most if not all of the time [@fischerWhereHaveAll2010; @parkinsonEmotionsAreSocial1996; @rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009]; (2) the dyadic level, such as in direct dialogue or collaboration; (3) the group-level, in which people share a common identities and goals to attain; and (4) the cultural level, where the analysis focus on macro-elements such as history and tradition. A recent overarching synthesis on the social function of emotions across all levels proposed by Fischer and Manstead [-@fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016] identifies two complementary, but distinct, functions performed by emotions: affiliation, and distancing. The affiliation function serves to form and maintain positive social relationship with others, whereas the distancing function helps in establishing and maintaining a social position relative to others. Other social functions of emotions, further developed below in the chapter, comprise the spontaneous tendency of people to share their emotions with others [@rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005], the use of emotional information to better understand behavior and appropriate conduct in social situations [@parkinsonEmotionsInterpersonalInteractions2010; @vankleefHowEmotionsRegulate2009], or situation in which people voluntary attempt to act upon emotions in others [@netzerInterpersonalInstrumentalEmotion2015; @reeckSocialRegulationEmotion2016; @zakiInterpersonalEmotionRegulation2013].
