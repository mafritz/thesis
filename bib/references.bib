  abstract = {We defend a functionalist approach to emotion that begins by focusing on emotions as central states with causal connections to behavior and to other cognitive states. The approach brackets the conscious experience of emotion, lists plausible features that emotions exhibit, and argues that alternative schemes (e.g., focusing on feelings or on neurobiology as the starting point) are unpromising candidates. We conclude with the benefits of our approach: one can study emotions in animals; one can look in the brain for the implementation of specific features; and one ends up with an architecture of the mind in which emotions are fully accommodated through their relations to the rest of cognition. Our article focuses on arguing for this general approach; as such, it is an essay in the philosophy of emotion rather than in the psychology or neuroscience of emotion.},

  abstract = {When designing a study, the planned sample size is often based on power analyses. One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index (η2, ω2and ϵ2) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of η2in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies. Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue. We urge researchers to consider alternative approaches to determining the sample size of their studies, and discuss several options.},

Further, relationship partners with less power made more of the change necessary for convergence to occur. Consistent with the proposed benefits of emotional similarity, relationships whose partners were more emotionally similar were more cohesive and less likely to dissolve. Discussion focuses on implications of emotional convergence and on potential mechanisms.},

The main goal of this work is to analyze the effects of emotion awareness, supported by specific teaching strategies, on students' motivation, engagement, self-regulation and learning outcome in long-term blended collaborative learning practices. A bilateral goal also involves an initial study that explores the way emotion awareness affects teacher's attitude and feedback as well as the competencies that teachers need to have in order to achieve a positive change on students' affective and cognitive state. To this end a quasi-experimental study was designed with high school students. The results of this study show that when students are aware of their emotions and guided by specific teaching strategies, their learning performance improves in relation to their motivation, engagement and self-regulation. Likewise, when teachers are conscious of students' emotional state their attitude and feedback become more effective and timely.},

  abstract = {We study the incidence (rate of occurrence), persistence (rate of reoccurrence immediately after occurrence), and impact (effect on behavior) of students' cognitive-affective states during their use of three different computer-based learning environments. Students' cognitive-affective states are studied using different populations (Philippines, USA), different methods (quantitative field observation, self-report), and different types of learning environments (dialogue tutor, problem-solving game, and problem-solving-based Intelligent Tutoring System). By varying the studies along these multiple factors, we can have greater confidence that findings which generalize across studies are robust. The incidence, persistence, and impact of boredom, frustration, confusion, engaged concentration, delight, and surprise were compared. We found that boredom was very persistent across learning environments and was associated with poorer learning and problem behaviors, such as gaming the system. Despite prior hypothesis to the contrary, frustration was less persistent, less associated with poorer learning, and did not appear to be an antecedent to gaming the system. Confusion and engaged concentration were the most common states within all three learning environments. Experiences of delight and surprise were rare. These findings suggest that significant effort should be put into detecting and responding to boredom and confusion, with a particular emphasis on developing pedagogical interventions to disrupt the "vicious cycles" which occur when a student becomes bored and remains bored for long periods of time. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Results suggest that computer-mediated communica-tion leads to decreases in group effectiveness, increases in time required to complete tasks, and decreases in member satisfaction compared to face-to-face groups. All of the moderators tested (anonymity in the group process, limited versus unlimited time to reach decisions, group size, and task type) were significant for at least one of the dependent variables.

Over the past 20 years, the integration of computers and communication tech-nologies has revolutionized communication and made possible new and ex-panded forms of group work. In fact, for many people, electronic messaging and computer conferencing are becoming more commonplace than using the postal service or even the telephone. The increased use of computer networks to conduct business has been stimulated by decreasing costs; increased accessi-bility of information; and the rapid exchange of documents, databases, and messages (Siegel, Dubrovsky, Kiesler, \& McGuire, 1986).

While a 100-point scale is intuitive in many respects and allows for relative judgments, information describing how the numeric score translates into an absolute judgment of usability is not known. To help answer that question, a seven-point adjective-anchored Likert scale was added as an eleventh question to nearly 1,000 SUS surveys. Results show that the Likert scale scores correlate extremely well with the SUS scores (r=0.822). The addition of the adjective rating scale to the SUS may help practitioners interpret individual SUS scores and aid in explaining the results to non-human factors professionals.},

I propose one solution to this paradox: People experience an emotion when they conceptualize an instance of affective feeling. In this view, the experience of emotion is an act of categorization, guided by embodied knowledge about emotion. The result is a model of emotion experience that has much in common with the social psychological literature on person perception and with literature on embodied conceptual knowledge as it has recently been applied to social psychology.},

We describe the nomological network of group affect, examining both its group-level antecedents and group-level consequences. Antecedents include group leadership, group member attributes, and interactions between and relationships among group members. Consequences of group affect include attitudes about the group and group-level cooperation and conflict, creativity, decision making, and performance.

The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification.},

  abstract = {This survey provides an introduction into eye tracking visualization with an overview of existing techniques. Eye tracking is important for evaluating user behaviour. Analysing eye tracking data is typically done quantitatively, applying statistical methods. However, in recent years, researchers have been increasingly using qualitative and exploratory analysis methods based on visualization techniques. For this state-of-the-art report, we investigated about 110 research papers presenting visualization techniques for eye tracking data. We classified these visualization techniques and identified two main categories: point-based methods and methods based on areas of interest. Additionally, we conducted an expert review asking leading eye tracking experts how they apply visualization techniques in their analysis of eye tracking data. Based on the experts' feedback, we identified challenges that have to be tackled in the future so that visualizations will become even more widely applied in eye tracking research.},

Although recent findings indicate emotional equivalence between face-to-face and email communication, there is limited evidence of nonverbal behaviors in text-based communication, especially the kinds of unintentional displays central to emotion perception in face-to-face interactions. We investigate whether unintentional emotion cues occur in text-based communication by proposing that communication mistakes (e.g., typos) influence emotion perception. Across six studies, we show that communication errors amplify perceptions of email sender?s emotions?both negative (Studies 1A?2, 4, 5) and positive (Study 3). Furthermore, by contrasting perceptions of message senders who make mistakes in emotional versus unemotional contexts (Study 5), we show that people partially excuse message sender communication errors in emotional (versus unemotional) contexts, attributing such mistakes to the sender?s emotional state rather than solely their intelligence level. These studies suggest that nonverbal behavior in text-based and face-to-face communication may be more comparable than previously thought.},

Subjective reports were measured to a series of pictures that varied in both affective valence and intensity. Correlations across the two rating methods were high both for reports of experienced pleasure and felt arousal. Differences obtained in the dominance dimension of the two instruments suggest that SAM may better track the personal response to an affective stimulus. SAM is an inexpensive, easy method for quickly assessing reports of affective response in many contexts.},

  abstract = {In this article we report on a new digital interactive self-report method for the measurement of human affect. The AffectButton (Broekens and Brinkman, 2009. ACII 2009: IEEE) is a button that enables users to provide affective feedback in terms of values on the well-known three affective dimensions of pleasure (valence), arousal and dominance. The AffectButton is an interface component that functions and looks like a medium-sized button. The button presents one dynamically changing iconic facial expression that changes based on the coordinates of the user's pointer in the button. To give affective feedback the user selects the most appropriate expression by clicking the button, effectively enabling 1-click affective self-report on 3 affective dimensions. Here we analyze 5 previously published studies, and 3 novel large-scale studies (n=325, n=202, n=128). Our results show the reliability, validity, and usability of the button for acquiring three types of affective feedback in various domains. The tested domains are holiday preferences, real-time music annotation, emotion words, and textual situation descriptions (ANET). The types of affective feedback tested are preferences, affect attribution to the previously mentioned stimuli, and self-reported mood. All of the subjects tested were Dutch and aged between 15 and 56 years. We end this article with a discussion of the limitations of the AffectButton and of its relevance to areas including recommender systems, preference elicitation, social computing, online surveys, coaching and tutoring, experimental psychology and psychometrics, content annotation, and game consoles. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Emotion determines how we perceive our world, organise our memory, and make important decisions. In this review, we provide an overview of current theorising and research in the Affective Sciences. We describe how psychological theories of emotion conceptualise the interactions of cognitive and emotional processes.

In this review we examine the special role of such “emotional” stimuli in perception and categorisation. To this end, we first discuss some fundamental aspects of perception, with an emphasis on the cognitive process of categorisation. We then tackle the questions: “What is an emotional stimulus?” and “What is an emotion category?” Afterwards, we illustrate, with a review of key findings from the empirical literature, (i) how stimuli are categorised as emotional, and (ii) how the perceptual processing of emotional stimuli is prioritised to allow for a rapid preparation of adaptive responses. To conclude, we discuss how research on the perception of emotional stimuli can contribute to current debates in psychology, namely (i) about the role of bottom-up vs. top-down factors in emotional processing and experience, and (ii) about the nature of the relationship between cognition and emotion.},

In other words, emotions can be seen as temporal interpersonal systems. This review summarizes current models for temporal interpersonal emotion systems (TIES), evidence they matter beyond levels of emotional responding, their connections with relationship quality and interpersonal regulation, and some of the challenges for studying them. Important directions for future research include distinguishing between different patterns of interpersonal emotional dynamics and extending theory and experimental work to uncover mechanisms for altering harmful TIES and promoting beneficial ones. Emotions can be viewed from a number of perspectives, each of which focuses the viewer on different aspects. Stating that they are temporal interpersonal systems focuses us on the following: first, emotions are not static nor located in a particular instance of time, but rather emerge, evolve and dissolve across time, second, emo-tions cannot be fully understood by focusing on individ-uals because they both depend upon and ripple through interpersonal contexts, potentially influencing people far removed from each other, and third, emotions are dynamic systems, meaning that their cumulative behavior emerges from nonlinear interactions and feedback loops amongst sub-components (e.g., multiple people's emo-tional experience, physiology, expressive behavior), forc-ing us to go beyond simplistic linear models to adequately represent them [1].},

This is followed by an overview of the major findings of a recent meta-analysis aimed at identifying a subset of learning-centered affective states that generalize across students, learning technologies, learning tasks, and experimental methodologies. We then turn our attention to the two major types of AALTs: reactive systems that respond to affect once it occurs and proactive systems that aim to induce or impede certain affective states. Affective AutoTutor, GazeTutor, and UNC-ITSpoke are presented as examples of reactive AALTs, while Crystal Island and ConfusionTutor are included as examples of proactive AALTs. Some of the open issues in the area of AALTs are discussed. These include scalability for real-world contexts, good-enough classification accuracy, and levels of analysis for affective responding.

However, while we express emotions in various life settings, the world of computing seems to struggle with supporting and incorporating the emotional dimension.

Support for such collaboration has been mainly provided by tools that visualize membership awareness, preference awareness and decision awareness. However, these mechanisms do not address group dynamic issues: how member may affect each other. In this paper, we investigate the roles of emotion awareness tools and how they may enable positive group dynamics. We first describe the design process behind a set of dynamic emoticons, which we call empatheticons. We then show that they allow users to represent, annotate, and visualize group members' emotions in GroupFun, a group music recommender. An in-depth user study (N = 18) with GroupFun demonstrates that users' emotion annotation for recommended songs can be influenced by other group members. Most importantly, empatheticons enhance users' perceptions of the connectedness (immediacy) and familiarity (intimacy) with each other and the positive group dynamics.},

  abstract = {There has been much confusion and controversy concerning the concept of emotional intelligence (EI). Three issues have been particularly bothersome. The first concerns the many conflicting definitions and models of EI. To address this issue, I propose that we distinguish between definitions and models and then adopt a single definition on which the major theorists already seem to agree. I further propose that we more clearly distinguish between EI and the related concept of emotional and social competence (ESC). The second issue that has generated concern is the question of how valid existing measures are. After reviewing the research on the psychometric properties of several popular tests, I conclude that although there is some support for many of them, they all have inherent limitations. We need to rely more on alternative measurement strategies that have been available for some time and also develop new measures that are more sensitive to context. The third area of contention concerns the significance of EI for outcomes such as job performance or leadership effectiveness. Recent research, not available to earlier critics, suggests that EI is positively associated with performance. However, certain ESCs are likely to be stronger predictors of performance than EI in many situations. Also, EI is likely to be more important in certain kinds of situations, such as those involving social interaction or significant levels of stress. Context makes a difference.},

  abstract = {This essay examines the economics of patronage in the production of knowledge and its influence upon the historical formation of key elements in the ethos and organizational structure of publicly funded `open science.' The emergence during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of the idea and practice of `open science' was a distinctive and vital organizational aspect of the Scientific Revolution. It represented a break from the previously dominant ethos of secrecy in the pursuit of Nature's Secrets, to a new set of norms, incentives, and organizational structures that reinforced scientific researchers' commitments to rapid disclosure of new knowledge. The rise of `cooperative rivalries' in the revelation of new knowledge, is seen as a functional response to heightened asymmetric information problems posed for the Renaissance system of court-patronage of the arts and sciences; pre-existing informational asymmetries had been exacerbated by the claims of mathematicians and the increasing practical reliance upon new mathematical techniques in a variety of `contexts of application.' Reputational competition among Europe's noble patrons motivated much of their efforts to attract to their courts the most prestigious natural philosophers, was no less crucial in the workings of that system than was the concern among their would-be clients to raise their peer-based reputational status. In late Renaissance Europe, the feudal legacy of fragmented political authority had resulted in relations between noble patrons and their savantclients that resembled the situation modern economists describe as `common agency contracting in substitutes' – competition among incompletely informed principals for the dedicated services of multiple agents. These conditions tended to result in contract terms (especially with regard to autonomy and financial support) that left agent client members of the nascent scientific communities better positioned to retain larger information rents on their specialized knowledge. This encouraged entry into their emerging disciplines, and enabled them collectively to develop a stronger degree of professional autonomy for their programs of inquiry within the increasingly specialized and formal scientific academies (such the Académie royale des Sciences and the Royal Society) that had attracted the patronage of rival absolutist States of Western Europe during the latter part of the seventeenth century. The institutionalization of `open science' that took place within those settings is shown to have continuities with the use by scientists of the earlier humanist academies, and with the logic of regal patronage, rather than being driven by the material requirements of new observational and experimental techniques.},

Hypotheses of the model were tested in two experiments where learners engaged in trialogues on scientific reasoning concepts in a simulated collaborative learning session with animated agents playing the role of a tutor and a peer student. Confusion was experimentally induced via a contradictory-information manipulation involving the animated agents expressing incorrect and/or contradictory opinions and asking the (human) learners to decide which opinion had more scientific merit. The results indicated that self-reports of confusion were largely insensitive to the manipulations. However, confusion was manifested by more objective measures that inferred confusion on the basis of learners' responses immediately following contradictions. Furthermore, whereas the contradictions had no effect on learning when learners were not confused by the manipulations, performance on multiple-choice posttests and on transfer tests was substantially higher when the contradictions were successful in confusing learners. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model predicts that learners in a state of engagement/flow will experience cognitive disequilibrium and confusion when they face contradictions, incongruities, anomalies, obstacles to goals, and other impasses. Learners revert into the engaged/flow state if equilibrium is restored through thought, reflection, and problem solving. However, failure to restore equilibrium as well as obstacles that block goals trigger frustration, which, if unresolved, will eventually lead to boredom. The major hypotheses of the model were supported in two studies in which participants completed a 32-35. min tutoring session with a computer tutor. Their affective states were tracked at approximately 110 points in their tutoring sessions via a retrospective affect judgment protocol. Time series analyses confirmed the presence of confusion-engagement/flow, boredom-frustration, and confusion-frustration oscillations. We discuss enhancements of the model to address individual differences and pedagogical and motivational strategies that are inspired by the model. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article provides an initial attempt to answer this question with a selective meta-analysis of 24 studies that utilized a mixture of methodologies (online self-reports, online observations, emote-aloud protocols, cued recall) and affect judges (students them- selves, untrained peers, trained judges) for fine-grained monitoring of 14 discrete affective states of 1,740 middle school, high school, college, and adult students in 5 countries. Affective states occurred over the course of interactions with a range of learning technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems, serious games, simulation environments, and simple computer interfaces. Standardized effect sizes of relative frequency, computed by comparing the proportional occurrence of each affective state to the other states in each study, were modeled with random-effects models. Engagement/flow was consistently found to be relatively frequent (d? ? 2.5), and contempt, anger, disgust, sadness, anxiety, delight, fear, and surprise were consistently infrequent, with d? ranging from ?6.5 to ?0.78. Effects for boredom (d? ? 0.19), confusion (d? ? 0.12), curiosity (d? ??0.10), happiness (d? ??0.13), and frustration (d? ??2.5) varied substantially across studies. Mixed-effects models indicated that the source of the affect judgments (self vs. observers) and the authenticity of the learning contexts (classroom vs. laboratory) accounted for greater heterogeneity than the use of advanced learning technologies and training time. Theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed.},

Prior research on the effects of emotional expressions on observers' inferential processes has focused mostly on inferences regarding the personality traits of the expresser, such as dominance and affiliation. We extend this line of research by exploring the possibility that emotional expressions shape observers' construal of social situations. Across three vignette studies, an interaction partner's expressions of anger, compared to expressions of happiness or disappointment, led observers to construe hypothetical situations as less cooperative, both in dyads and groups. These effects occurred even when factual information regarding the cooperativeness or competitiveness of the situation was provided, attesting to the power of emotional expressions in shaping the construal of social situations. Results are discussed in relation to appraisal theory, reverse appraisals, emotions as social information theory, and the emergence of cooperation in groups and cultures.},

  abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available.

Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science's capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.},

  abstract = {Theory creation underlies the basic laws ofevolution, callingfor both random varia-tion (loosening) and critical selection processes (tightening). Theory construction re-quires support of both components. However, whereas psychology has created a re-fined methodology for the tightening stage, attempts to understand the loosening stage of the creative cycle are conspicuously missing. I propose that both aspects of the creative cycle of theory formation can be acquired and exercised playfully, through distinct loosening and tightening games. I outline the rules of these games and illustrate them with examples from contemporary research. In my opinion, the topic and objective of this special issue is a timely one. For half a century now, the scien-tific discipline of psychology in general and social psy-chology in particular have been flourishing, both in terms of empirical research and fields of application. In an interdisciplinary comparison, psychology has gained a high reputation, almost equivalent to classical science, due to an elaborated methodology; knowledge export to other disciplines; contributions to economi-cal, political, and societal problems; and the charisma of its leading researchers. However, at the contempo-rary end of this incontestable success story, current (so-cial) psychology is facing a demanding developmental task, namely, to organize the rapidly growing knowl-edge in theoretical space. One might characterize the current historical situa-tion as the end of an era of hunters and gatherers that have been chasing after interesting phenomena and "empirical food" for future consumption, thereby en-hancing their weapons (methods) and circumscribing their territories (paradigms and subdisciplines). After this productive acquisition period, however, it seems hard to oversee the entire harvest (findings) and to de-cide which healthy (reliable, replicable) goods should be conserved and which should be discarded as poison-ous or hard to digest (invalid, illusory). Theories are re-quired to find out which products of hunting and gath-ering could be combined to breed something novel that can exist on its own.},

Emotional stimuli or antecedents are dynamic and change over time because they often interact and have a specific relationship with the subject. Earlier emotional interactions may, for example, intensify later emotional reactions to a specific person, or our anger reactions towards powerful or powerless others may differ considerably. Thus, we suggest that such social factors not only affect the intensity, but also the nature of emotional experiences and expressions, and specifically the nature of the social movement (e.g., moving towards, away, or against). We discuss different processes that are implicated in the relation between the social environment and our emotions, describe how emotional expressions shape social behavior, and provide suggestions for incorporating the social dimension of emotion in future research.},

  abstract = {For more than half a century, emotion researchers have attempted to establish the dimensional space that most economically accounts for similarities and differences in emotional experience. Today, many researchers focus exclusively on two-dimensional models involving valence and arousal. Adopting a theoretically based approach, we show for three languages that four dimensions are needed to satisfactorily represent similarities and differences in the meaning of emotion words. In order of importance, these dimensions are evaluationpleasantness, potency-control, activation-arousal, and unpredictability. They were identified on the basis of the applicability of 144 features representing the six components of emotions: (a) appraisals of events, (b) psychophysiological changes, (c) motor expressions, (d) action tendencies, (e) subjective experiences, and (f) emotion regulation.},

  abstract = {The Dynamic Emotion Wheel (DEW) is an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) developed as part of the EATMINT project, whose objective is to explore the relationship between emotion – defined accordingly to appraisal/componential theories – and computer-mediated collaboration . The DEW is inspired by the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), a self-report instrument that arranges a set of modal emotions in a circle with two appraisal dimensions as axes: Valence and Control. The DEW is an adaptation of the GEW in the perspective of its co-existence with another computer-mediated task, which means that the EAT must occupy only a limited part of the screen and should not distract too much from the primary task. For this reason, the DEW does not show all modal emotions at the same time, but dynamically compute a subset of emotions according to two range-input values representing the same appraisal criteria of the GEW. The subset, thus, dynamically updates according to variations in appraisal criteria. Furthermore, the DEW provides graphical representation of the evolution of registered emotional episodes with respect to both the appraisal dimensions and the related subjective feeling. The DEW aims to enhance real time awareness of both self and other participant's emotional episodes in an ongoing collaborative task. This contribution illustrates the comprehensive development process of the DEW, which includes a usability test conducted in experimental settings where participants were engaged in a simulated collaborative task on a computer screen equipped with an eye-tracking device.},

We conducted three experiments to examine the impact of smiley use on virtual first impressions in work-related contexts. Our findings provide first-time evidence that, contrary to actual smiles, smileys do not increase perceptions of warmth and actually decrease perceptions of competence. Perceptions of low competence in turn undermined information sharing. The adverse effects of smiley use are moderated by the formality of the social context and mediated by perceptions of message appropriateness. These results indicate that a smiley is not a smile. The findings have implications for theorizing on the social functionality of virtual emotional expressions.},

Third, we review recent neuroscience evidence that bolsters our claim of the central importance of the synchronization of neuronal assemblies at different levels of processing.},

According to Gross's \textasciitilde 1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271–299! process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.},

Social presence alone contributed about 60\% of this variance, suggesting that it may be a very strong predictor of satisfaction. Reliability data on the social presence scale is provided. The results also indicated that participants who felt a higher sense of social presence enhanced their socioemotional experience by using emoticons to express missing nonverbal cues in written form.

We focus on how small groups perform generation and execution tasks in medium-sized shared workspaces – tasks where group members frequently shift between individual and shared activities during the work session. We have built a three-part framework that examines the concept of workspace awareness and that helps designers understand the concept for purposes of designing awareness support in groupware. The framework sets out elements of knowledge that make up workspace awareness, perceptual mechanisms used to maintain awareness, and the ways that people use workspace awareness in collaboration. The framework also organizes previous research on awareness and extends it to provide designers with a vocabulary and a set of ground rules for analysing work situations, for comparing awareness devices, and for explaining evaluation results. The basic structure of the theory can be used to describe other kinds of awareness that are important to the usability of groupware.},

A possible scheme for the appraisal of substantive hypotheses is offered, the corroboration of which is a necessary prerequisite for scientific explanations and predictions. The scheme is partly based on the Neyman–Pearson theory. This theory, though not perfect, is superior to its competitors, especially when examining substantive hypotheses. The many statistical and extra-statistical decisions prior to experimentation and the inevitable subjectivity of our research endeavors are emphasized. If feasible, statistical problems should be discussed from an extra-statistical methodological/epistemological viewpoint.},

Despite the enormous amount of attention given to this topic, psychology's understanding of ToSS remains deficient. The major problem stems from a widespread and uncritical acceptance of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), which is an indefensible amalgam of ideas adapted from Fisher's thinking on the subject and from Neyman and Pearson's alternative account. To correct for the deficiencies of the hybrid, it is suggested that psychology avail itself of two important and more recent viewpoints on ToSS, namely the neo-Fisherian and the error-statistical perspectives. The neo-Fisherian perspective endeavors to improve on Fisher's original account and rejects key elements of Neyman and Pearson's alternative. In contrast, the error-statistical perspective builds on the strengths of both statistical traditions. It is suggested that these more recent outlooks on ToSS are a definite improvement on NHST, especially the error-statistical position. It is suggested that ToSS can play a useful, if limited, role in psychological research. At the end, some lessons learnt from the extensive debates about ToSS are presented.},

Specifically, we postulate that people can reconstruct or “reverse engineer” the appraisals underlying an emotional reaction and use this appraisal information to draw person perception inferences. As predicted, a person who reacted with anger to blame was perceived as more aggressive, and self-confident, but also as less warm and gentle than a person who reacted with sadness (Study 1). A person who reacted with a smile (Study 1) or remained neutral (Study 2) was perceived as self-confident but also as unemotional. These perceptions were mediated by perceived appraisals.},

Recommendations are also shared to assist researchers in improving their emotion measurement methodologies. This chapter was written with the educational psychology community in mind to help support a growing interest in alternative and complimentary methods to selfreport measures.

We also discuss concrete and accessible tools that can be used to support both educators' own skill development and that of their students. We demonstrate how educators can integrate the teaching of emotion regulation through direct instruction, its integration into existing curricula, and daily practices and routines. The examples we provide are part of RULER, an evidence-based, whole school approach to social and emotional learning (SEL) that was developed at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. RULER is grounded in the theory of emotional intelligence, which emphasizes the critical role of emotion regulation in healthy development.},

The term “loess” is an acronym for “local regression” and the entire procedure is a fairly direct generalization of traditional least-squares methods for data analysis. Loess is nonparametric in the sense that the fitting technique does not require an a priori specification of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Although it is used most frequently as a scatterplot smoother, loess can be generalized very easily to multivariate data; there are also inferential procedures for confidence intervals and other statistical tests. For all of these reasons, loess is a useful tool for data exploration and analysis in the social sciences. And, loess should be particularly helpful in the field of elections and voting behavior because theories often lead to expectations of nonlinear empirical relationships even though prior substantive considerations provide very little guidance about precise functional forms. ï›™ 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During recent decades, self-regulated learning (SRL) has become a major research field. SRL successfully integrates the cognitive and motivational components of learning. Self-regulation is usually seen as an individual process, with the social aspects of regulation conceptualized as one aspect of the context. However, recent research has begun to investigate whether self-regulation processes are complemented by socially shared regulation processes. AIMS: The presented study investigated what kind of socio-emotional challenges students experience during collaborative learning and whether the students regulate the emotions evoked during these situations. The interplay of the emotion regulation processes between the individual and the group was also studied. SAMPLE: The sample for this study was 63 teacher education students who studied in groups of three to five during three collaborative learning tasks. METHOD: Students' interpretations of experienced social challenges and their attempts to regulate emotions evoked by these challenges were collected following each task using the Adaptive Instrument for the Regulation of Emotions. RESULTS: The results indicated that students experienced a variety of social challenges. Students also reported the use of shared regulation in addition to self-regulation. Finally, the results suggested that intrinsic group dynamics are derived from both individual and social elements of collaborative situations. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study support the assumption that students can regulate emotions collaboratively as well as individually. The study contributes to our understanding of the social aspects of emotional regulation in collaborative learning contexts.},

We chose the concept of volition to frame the analysis of the various kinds of descriptions the students give of their emotional experiences in collaborative inquiry. Process-oriented interviews were conducted during and after lessons, and questions dealing with students' self-related beliefs and feelings, and the learning environment were asked. The analysis was complemented with a micro-level video analysis of two students' working processes. The results show that students' descriptions of their emotions had several origins; five different categories were created to describe the various sources of emotional experiences. The case descriptions demonstrate how students express and control their emotions, as well as their motivation. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

Traditionally in learning there has been a division between cognition and affect: where cognition is concerned with skills and processes such as thinking and problem-solving and affect with emotional areas such as motivation, attitudes, feelings. Affective issues have been viewed as somewhat problematic in studying learning, so although it is well known that learner attitude, motivation, and emotional state are very important, they have often been excluded from the frame of research, or studied separately from cognitive learning. This position is gradually changing and this paper considers what previous research has been conducted in these areas. It discusses the role of affective factors in three main areas of collaboration: in settings where learners are co-located, in on-line communities and to support and develop socio-emotional skills. It considers relevant developments in these areas, what the outcomes have been and suggests important directions for future research.},

We suggest ways in which emotion may augment or interfere with the selective enhancement of particular memory details, using both online and offline processes, and discuss how these effects of emotion may contribute to memory distortions in affective disorders.},

Although these environments can support communication and collaboration, both research and field observations are not always positive about their working. This article focuses on factors which may cause this discrepancy, centering on two pitfalls that appear to impede achieving the desired results, namely taking for granted that participants will socially interact simply because the environment makes it possible and neglecting the social (psychological) dimension of the desired social interaction. It examines the social interactions which determine how groups develop, how sound social spaces characterized by group cohesion, trust, respect and belonging are established, and how a sense of community of learning is established. It concludes with an evaluation of educational techniques proposed by instructors and educators, as well as the findings of educational researchers and guidelines for avoiding the pitfalls. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Although there are research findings supporting the positive effects of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), problems have been reported regarding the learning process itself, group formation, and group dynamics. These problems can be traced back to impeded social interaction between group members. Social interaction is necessary (a) for group members to learn from each other in a CSCL environment and (b) for socioemotional processes to help create a social space where trust, sense of community, and strong interpersonal relationships exist. This article introduces a theoretical framework consisting of three core elements: sociability, social space, and social presence, along with their relationships with group members' mental models, social affordances and learning outcomes. It postulates that the three core elements influence the social interaction needed for both learning and the emergence of a social space.

Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package).

  abstract = {Scientists should be able to provide support for the absence of a meaningful effect. Currently, researchers often incorrectly conclude an effect is absent based a nonsignificant result. A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The TOST procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds. Extending your statistical tool kit with equivalence tests is an easy way to improve your statistical and theoretical inferences. Scientists should be able to provide support for the null hypothesis. A limitation of the widespread use of traditional significance tests, where the null hypothesis is that the true effect size is zero, is that the absence of an effect can be rejected, but not statistically supported. When you perform a statistical test, and the outcome is a p value larger than the a level (e.g., p {$>$} .05), the only formally correct conclusion is that the data are not surprising, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It is not possible to conclude there is no effect when p {$>$} a—our test might simply have lacked the statistical power to detect a true effect. It is statistically impossible to support the hypothesis that a true effect size is exactly zero. What is possible in a frequentist hypothesis testing framework is to statistically reject effects large enough to be deemed worthwhile. When researchers want to argue for the absence of an effect that is large enough to be worthwhile to examine, they can test for equivalence (Wellek, 2010). By rejecting an effect (indicated in this article by D) more extreme than predetermined lower and upper equivalence bounds (ÀD L and D U , e.g., effect sizes of Cohen's d ¼ À.3 and d ¼ .3), we can act as if the true effect is close enough to zero for our practical purposes. Equivalence testing originates from the field of pharmacokinetics (Hauck \& Anderson, 1984), where researchers sometimes want to show that a new cheaper drug works just as well as an existing drug (for an overview, see Senn, 2007, Chapters 15 and 22). A very simple equivalence testing approach is the " two one-sided tests " (TOST) procedure (Schuirmann, 1987). In the TOST procedure, an upper (D U) and lower (ÀD L) equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI; e.g., a positive or neg-ative difference of d ¼ .3). Two composite null hypotheses are tested: H0 1 : D ÀD L and H0 2 : D ! D U . When both these one-sided tests can be statistically rejected, we can conclude that ÀD L {$<$} D {$<$} D U or that the observed effect falls within the equivalence bounds and is close enough to zero to be practi-cally equivalent (Seaman \& Serlin, 1998). Psychologists often incorrectly conclude there is no effect based on a nonsignificant test result. For example, the words " no effect " had been used in 108 articles published in Social Psychological and Personality Science up to August 2016. Manual inspection revealed that in almost all of these articles, the conclusion of " no effect " was based on statistical nonsigni-ficance. Finch, Cumming, and Thomason (2001) reported that in the Journal of Applied Psychology, a stable average of around 38\% of articles with nonsignificant results accept the null hypothesis. This practice is problematic. With small sam-ple sizes, nonsignificant test results are hardly indicative of the absence of a true effect, and with huge sample sizes, effects can be statistically significant but practically and theo-retically irrelevant.

  abstract = {We distinguish diagrammatic from sentential paper-and-pencil representations of information by developing alternative models of information-processing systems that are informationally equivalent and that can be characterized as sentential or diagrammatic. Sentential representations are sequential, like the propositions in a text. Diagrammatic representations are indexed by location in a plane. Diagrammatic representations also typically display information that is only implicit in sentential representations and that therefore has to be computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit for use. We then contrast the computational efficiency of these representations for solving several illustrative problems in mathematics and physics. When two representations are informationally equivalent, their computational efficiency depends on the information-processing operators that act on them. Two sets of operators may differ in their capabilities for recognizing patterns, in the inferences they can carry out directly, and in their control strategies (in particular, the control of search). Diagrammatic and sentential representations support operators that differ in all of these respects. Operators working on one representation may recognize features readily or make inferences directly that are difficult to realize in the other representation. Most important, however, are differences in the efficiency of search for information and in the explicitness of information. In the representations we call diagrammatic, information is organized by location, and often much of the information needed to make an inference is present and explicit at a single location. In addition, cues to the next logical step in the problem may be present at an adjacent location. Therefore problem solving can proceed through a smooth traversal of the diagram, and may require very little search or computation of elements that had been implicit.},

We examined the relations between the two constructs as well as their relations with teachers' discrete emotions in a sample of 189 secondary school teachers. The results showed that reappraisal correlated positively with deep acting, whereas suppression correlated positively with surface acting. The findings further suggest that reappraisal and deep acting are linked to experiencing positive emo-tions, whereas suppression and surface acting are linked to experiencing negative emotions. However, there also were some differences in how emotion regulation and emotional labor were related to teachers' discrete emotional experiences. Specifically, reappraisal and deep acting strategies were positively related to enjoyment; in addition, deep acting was negatively related to negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, and frustration. By contrast, suppression and surface acting strategies were positively associated with negative emotions (i.e., suppression with anxiety; surface acting with anxiety, anger, and frustration), and surface acting was negatively associated with the positive emotion enjoyment.

To stimulate discussion of these issues, we propose a componential model in which emotions are seen to develop from simpler, reflex-like forms (“wired-in” sensory-motor processes) to complex cognitive-emotional patterns that result from the participation of at least two distinct levels of memory and information processing, a schematic and a conceptual level. These systems are typically activated by a continuous stimulus check process which evaluates five environment-organism attributes: novelty; pleasantness; goal conductiveness; coping potential; and consistency with social norms and self-relevant values. Questions about the relationship of cognition to emotion, and how two initially independent systems become inseparably interrelated, are transformed when viewed within the context of the dynamic, multilevel emotion processing system.},

  abstract = {This study explores how groups' negative socio-emotional interactions and related emotion regulation during a collaborative physics task are interconnected with 12-year-old primary school students' (N = 37) situated individual emotional experiences. To accomplish this, the study relates group-level video data analysis with students' self-reported emotional experiences. The results indicate that students' negative emotional experiences related to the task prior to collaborative working increase the group's emotion regulation during the collaboration and that negative group interactions negatively affect students' emotional experiences after the task. The study also shows that even though group-level regulation is more likely to change the valence of the group's interaction from negative to positive, regulation does not always succeed in making a difference to the students' overall emotional experiences.},

The present review examines this model in terms of whether different types of emotion-evocative stimuli are associated with discrete and invariant patterns of responding in each response system, how such responses are structured, and if such responses converge across different response systems. Across response systems, the bulk of the available evidence favours the idea that measures of emotional responding reflect dimensions rather than discrete states. In addition, experiential, physiological, and behavioural response systems are associated with unique sources of variance, which in turn limits the magnitude of convergence across measures. Accordingly, the authors suggest that there is no “gold standard” measure of emotional responding. Rather, experiential, physiological, and behavioural measures are all relevant to understanding emotion and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable.},

  abstract = {In 1990, two of us proposed the existence of a new intelligence, called " emotional intelligence. " Drawing on research findings in the areas of emotion, intelligence, psychotherapy, and cognition, we suggested that some people might be more intelligent about emotions than others (Salovey \& Mayer, 1990, p. 189). We called attention to people's problem solving in areas related to emotion: recognizing emotions in faces, understanding the meanings of emotion words, and managing feelings, among others. We argued that, collectively, such skills implied the existence of a broader, overlooked capacity to reason about emotions: an emotional intelligence (Cacioppo, Semin, \& Berntson, 2004; Haig, 2005). We later characterized the problem-solving people carried out as falling into four areas or " branches " (Mayer \& Salovey, 1997). In the present article, we revisit the theoretical aspects of our ability model of emotional intelligence, update the model so as to enhance its usefulness, and examine its implications. We begin by considering a set of principles that guide our thinking about emotional intelligence. After discussing these principles, we revise the four-branch model slightly. We then locate emo-tional intelligence amidst related " broad " intelligences, taking care to distinguish emotional intelligence from personal and social intelligences, and elucidate examples of reasoning for each one of these intelligences. We wrap up by considering the influence of the model and its implications for the future. We will describe a set of principles that have guided our theoriz-ing about emotional intelligence. Together, these principles— guidelines really—succinctly represent how we think about emotional intelligence. Abstract This article presents seven principles that have guided our thinking about emotional intelligence, some of them new. We have reformulated our original ability model here guided by these principles, clarified earlier statements of the model that were unclear, and revised portions of it in response to current research. In this revision, we also positioned emotional intelligence amidst other hot intelligences including personal and social intelligences, and examined the implications of the changes to the model. We discuss the present and future of the concept of emotional intelligence as a mental ability.},

Karl Popper's approach, with modifications, would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of “significant differences” are little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions. Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values (“consistency tests”) are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, second-order differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94\% success with zero false negatives. I},

  abstract = {This paper describes some of the consequences of introducing a face-to-face contact during an online collaborative learning session. Previous research on the development of online groups has suggested a critical transition period at the midpoint of a collaborative task in which group members redefine their behavior. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether face-to-face contact between participants during this period influences the patterns of participation, interaction, affect and behavior over time. Results show that a face-to-face contact introduced at the midpoint of a collaborative task has a positive influence on participation. However, a time sequence analysis of interactions revealed a further transition which appears between the face-to-face contact and the deadline. This transition is characterized by a decline of participation and task-focused interactions. At the same time, the analyses revealed an increase of interactions oriented towards emotional regulation and coordination, as well as a greater need of face-to-face contact, desire to drop out, and use of synchronous communications. These findings are based on an in-depth and longitudinal examination of a small sample, which limits their generalizability, but they may have a number of implications for the design of blended learning programs and the facilitation of collaborative tasks in distributed learning environments. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Nous avons conçu EMORE-L (EMOtion REport for E-Learning), un outil de reporting qui collecte non seulement les émotions ressenties mais également des informations en lien avec ces émotions comme l'évaluation que l'apprenant fait de la situation, et sa motivation à partager ses émotions avec les autres. Cet outil a été utilisé par 16 étudiants dans le cadre de leur formation universitaire à distance. La méthode utilisée est inspirée de l'Experience Sampling Method : chaque jour, pendant 15 jours consécutifs, les étudiants ont utilisé EMORE-L pour rapporter leurs émotions.

ABSTRACT Emotions can be used by students for diagnostic purposes, and can help them to regulate their learning process successfully. In the context of distance learning, few computer tools have been developed to promote awareness and use of emotions. In the present study, we designed a tool called EMORE-L (EMOtion Report for E-Learning) which is an emotion reporting tool able to collect emotions experienced by learners as well as different types of information related to emotions such as information about the way learners evaluate the situation, and their motivation to share their emotions with others. EMORE-L was used by 16 undergraduate students involved in a distance learning program. The method used was inspired from the Experience Sampling Method: students reported their emotions using EMORE-L for 15 consecutive days, one time a day. We present the results of this study and their implications for the design of emotion reporting tools.},

Results showed that the EAT stimulated participants to engage in a mutual modeling of emotions. In the EAT condition, the perceived amount of time spent on emotion modeling process was positively correlated to the perceived intensity of positive emotions after collaboration. The EAT increased the perceived degree of transactivity, but only for women. This study provides a first step in exploring the effect of emotion awareness in CMC tasks including a comparing approach for its gender-specific relevance. © ISLS.},

The valence hypothesis suggests preferential status for unpleasant, as compared with pleasant, stimuli in memory. The authors tested an alternative hypothesis derived from the appraisal theory of emotion, namely, that events that are relevant to the current concerns of the individual benefit from a memory advantage. In the present study, the authors demonstrate that initially neutral but goal conducive items (for game-related gain) remain stable in memory over time, whereas memory for goal irrelevant and goal obstructive items decline over time. They furthermore found that the affective evaluation of initially neutral items changed as a function of the goal relevance manipulation and that this change was stable over time. Taken together, findings support the relevance hypothesis of memory facilitation.},

Lack of such a definition is a constant source of numerous misunderstandings and a series of mostly fruitless debates. There is little hope that there ever will be agreement on a common definition of emotion, given the sacred traditions of the disciplines involved and the egos of the scholars working in these disciplines. Our aim here is more modest. We propose a list of elements for a working definition of emotion and discuss the justification for the inclusion of elements from our respective perspectives (philosophy and psychology). This working partial definition may at least serve as a litmus test to examine theories of emotion, old and new, across disciplinary boundaries.},

Social and emotional learning (SEL) refers to the processes of developing social and emotional competencies, which depend on individuals' capacity to recognize, understand, and manage emotions (i.e., emotional intelligence or EI). Consensus across disciplines about the importance of EI highlights the need to advance the science of how to teach SEL. RULER, an evidence-based approach to teaching EI, provides an educational framework that encompasses a set of practices for comprehensive SEL integration across a school or district. In this article, we describe RULER, explain how it teaches EI, and summarize evidence of its effectiveness.},

Collaborative work of 22 higher education students was followed during a three-month course. All face-to-face group sessions were videotaped (33. h), and cued retrospective recall interviews (with video stimulus) were conducted. The results indicate the differences between the groups with respect to the amount and the types of challenges. One case group was chosen (one that experienced more and particularly socio-emotional challenges) for the in-depth interaction analysis. Their overruling, status-centric, undermining and normative interaction created a socio-emotional conflict. Students were unable to maintain a well-balanced atmosphere, which led them to adopt avoidance-focused emotion regulation behaviour and to lower their on-task engagement. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This investigation, however, was designed to test whether people are also motivated to regulate the emotions of others to promote personal instrumental benefits. We tested whether participants would be motivated to increase unpleasant (Studies 1-3) or pleasant (Study 3) emotions in others, when they expected to benefit from doing so. We found that participants tried to increase an emotion in others when it was expected to lead to desirable outcomes, but decrease an emotion in others when it was expected to lead to undesirable outcomes. These instrumental motives were found even when they led participants to make their partners feel worse and their rivals feel better. Furthermore, the more participants expected others' emotions to result in behaviors that would personally benefit (or harm) participants themselves, the more they were motivated to increase (or decrease) the corresponding emotion in others. These findings demonstrate the operation of instrumental motives in regulating the emotions of others, whether friends of foes.},

This paper consid- ers two processes (emotion contagion and social appraisal) that may contribute to interpersonal emotion transfer (IET) effects of this kind. Research shows that people automatically mimic other people's perceived movements including their emotion expressions. However, IET does not seem to depend directly on mimicry, suggesting that other processes underlie contagion. Social appraisal is supported by studies showing that IET may depend on changes in explicit interpretations and evaluations of events, as well as implicitly registered cues relating to the direction of attention. Future research needs to focus more on the object-focus of emotion expressions and their contex- tual meaning in order to explain the variety of reported IET effects.},

The causes of this interference and its implications for the nature of attentional limitations have been controversial for 40 years, but recent experimental findings are beginning to provide some answers. Studies of the psychological refractory period effect indicate a stubborn bottleneck encompassing the process of choosing actions and probably memory retrieval generally, together with certain other cognitive operations. Other limitations associated with task preparation, sensory-perceptual processes, and timing can generate additional and distinct forms of interference. These conclusions challenge widely accepted ideas about attentional resources and probe reaction time methodologies. They also suggest new ways of thinking about continuous dual-task performance, effects of extraneous stimulation (e.g., stop signals), and automaticity. Implications for higher mental processes are discussed.},

The findings document the reliability, internal validity, and external validity of the instrument.

Trait EI moderated the relationship between cognitive ability and academic performance. In addition, pupils with high trait EI scores were less likely to have had unauthorized absences and less likely to have been excluded from school. Most trait EI effects persisted even after controlling for personality variance. It is concluded that the constellation of emotion-related self-perceived abilities and dispositions that the construct of trait EI encompasses is implicated in academic performance and deviant behavior, with effects that are particularly relevant to vulnerable or disadvantaged adolescents. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In historicizing and problematizing this binary, Jan Plamper opens emotions research beyond constructivism and universalism; he also maps a vast terrain of thought about feelings in anthropology, philosophy, sociology, linguistics, art history, political science, the life sciences - from nineteenth-century experimental psychology to the latest affective neuroscience - and history, from ancient times to the present day},

Factors were tested that, as postulated by several attentional models derived from theories of emotion, might modulate this bias. Overall, results showed a significant, albeit modest (Hedges' g ? .258), attentional bias for positive as compared with neutral stimuli. Moderator analyses revealed that the magnitude of this attentional bias varied as a function of arousal and that this bias was significantly larger when the emotional stimulus was relevant to specific concerns (e.g., hunger) of the participants compared with other positive stimuli that were less relevant to the participants' concerns. Moreover, the moderator analyses showed that attentional bias for positive stimuli was larger in paradigms that measure early, rather than late, attentional processing, suggesting that attentional bias for positive stimuli occurs rapidly and involuntarily. Implications for theories of emotion and attention are discussed.},

First, we introduce the reader to the basics of eye-movement technology, and also present key aspects of practical guidance to those who might be interested in using eye tracking in HCI research, whether in usability-evaluation studies, or for capturing people's eye movements as an input mechanism to drive system interaction. Second, we examine various ways in which eye movements can be systematically measured to examine interface usability. We illustrate the advantages of a range of different eyemovement metrics with reference to state-of-the-art usability research. Third, we discuss the various opportunities for eye-movement studies in future HCI research, and detail some of the challenges that need to be overcome to enable effective application of the technique in studying the complexities of advanced interactive-system use.},

It then discusses the brain network that is the source of the sensory amplification and other brain networks that are involved in attention. Next, it reviews studies of the development of attentional networks in early life. Finally, it indicates how the new tools available to explore the human brain can lead to further progress.},

  abstract = {As design of interactive products started to address the whole user experience, User Experience (UX) became an established field of research. Nevertheless UX design presents some risks, such as providing users with experiences that they do not wish. Furthermore, UX methodologies lack prescriptive tools for guiding designers. This paper establishes a link between UX research and Affordance theory and postulates the concept of Experience Affordances. Affordances represent a first step toward the development of prescriptive methods and help preventing designer from imposing experiences to users. Thus, a framework for describing product experience in terms of affordances is exposed and discussed by analysing exemplary products. In concluding the paper, the implications of the framework are presented. Y our most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning. With these words, in 1999 Bill Gates summarised two of the most relevant aspects underlying the success of a product: the happiness of the cus-tomers and the importance of learning from mistakes. More or less at the same time, researchers in Design often tried to assess the quantity of said mistakes: for instance, in 1997 a study pointed out that market failures constitute more than 99\% of the submitted projects in industry (Stevens \& Burley, 1997). Another research (Den Ouden, Yuan, Sonnemans, \& Brombacher, 2006), highlighted how high is the number of cases where the dissatisfaction of the customers is caused by so called soft failures, when products function accord-ing to the specification, but not according to the consumer's expectations. Contrariwise, a recent paper analysed many award-winning successful prod-ucts, in order to identify the features that distinguished them from competitors (Saunders, Seepersad, \& H€ oltt€ a-Otto, 2011). Assuming that successful prod-ucts typically delight customers by satisfying their needs in particularly inno-vative or unexpected ways, the study found out that, on average, successful products present multiple innovative characteristics, but more than two-thirds of them outperform users' expectations in terms of interaction.},

This organizing framework, the 'social regulatory cycle', specifies at multiple levels of description the act of regulating another person's emotions as well as the experience of being a target of regulation. The cycle describes the processing stages that lead regulators to attempt to change the emotions of a target person, the impact of regulation on the processes that generate emotions in the target, and the underlying neural systems.},

Although affective states and socio-emotional factors have an important effect on learning, few studies have classified and analyzed the results obtained by the scientific community to show their real impacts on in CSCL settings. The lack of a comprehensive overview and understanding of previous findings hampers the survey on research gaps, challenges and trends. This work addresses a systematic mapping of the literature for the summarization of results and discussion on research directions for the use of affective states and socio-emotional factors to support the development of intelligent CSCL environments. Six digital libraries were queried and 58 studies were deeply analyzed and categorized. Over 90\% of the studies considered emotion and personality traits in the CSCL environment; most studies used personality recognition by questionnaires rather than automatic sources of inference; most technological approaches employed instruments to collect, analyze and/or represent emotions; and most papers that reported empirical experiments focused on “emotional awareness” and “interaction among students in a CSCL environment”. We have identified three main challenges to be addressed by the community in the next decade for an adequate incorporation of affective states in CSCL environments: emotional awareness, orchestration of students' interaction and group formation.},

Nevertheless, few studies classify and analyze the research findings of the community to explicitly show the real impact and use of affective states in CSCL environments. Thus, this paper presents the development of a systematic mapping of the literature to answer three questions: (i) What are the affective states frequently used in CSCL environments? (ii) Were affective states in CSCL environment empirically evaluated? (iii) What are the types of environments that use affective states to support group learning? To answer these questions, seven digital libraries were queried and 31 studies were deeply analyzed. As main results, we verified that: (i) 54,84\% of the studies deal with 'emotions' in CSCL environments, (ii) 51,61\% of the studies were empirically evaluated, and (iii) LMS (38,71\%) and E-Learning systems (22,58\%) are the most common types of environments that use affective states to support collaborative learning. Finally, we also identified gaps and opportunities to conduct research on adaptive/intelligent CSCL systems to support better group formation and customization of group activities using affective states.},

In contrast, the 20th century ended with contentious argument over the utility of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The NHST controversy may have been at least partially irrelevant, because in certain ways the modeling revolution obviated the NHST argument. I begin with a history of NHST and modeling and their relation to one another. Next, I define and illustrate principles involved in developing and evaluating mathematical models. Following, I discuss the difference between using statistical procedures within a rule-based framework and building mathematical models from a scientific epistemology. Only the former is treated carefully in most psychology graduate training. The pedagogical implications of this imbalance and the revised pedagogy required to account for the modeling revolution are described. To conclude, I discuss how attention to modeling implies shifting statistical practice in certain progressive ways. The epistemological basis of statistics has moved away from being a set of procedures, applied mechanistically, and moved toward building and evaluating statistical and scientific models.},

  abstract = {Factor-analytic evidence has led most psychologists to describe affect as a set of dimensions, such as displeasure, distress, depression, excitement, and so on, with each dimension varying independently of the others. However, there is other evidence that rather than being independent, these affective dimensions are interrelated in a highly systematic fashion. The evidence suggests that these interrelationships can be represented by a spatial model in which affective concepts fall in a circle in the following order: pleasure (0), excitement (45), arousal (90), distress (135), displeasure (180), depression (225), sleepiness (270), and relaxation (315). This model was offered both as a way psychologists can represent the structure of affective experience, as assessed through self-report, and as a representation of the cognitive structure that laymen utilize in conceptualizing affect. Supportive evidence was obtained by scaling 28 emotion-denoting adjectives in 4 different ways: R. T. Ross's (1938) technique for a circular ordering of variables, a multidimensional scaling procedure based on perceived similarity among the terms, a unidimensional scaling on hypothesized pleasure–displeasure and degree-of-arousal dimensions, and a principal-components analysis of 343 Ss' self-reports of their current affective states.

Sixty-four university students participated in a remote computer-mediated dyadic learning scenario. Co-learners were provided (or not) with a visual representation of their peer's level of prior knowledge through what we refer to as a knowledge awareness tool (KAT). The results show that, providing co-learners with objective cues about the level of their peer's prior knowledge positively impacts learning outcomes. In addition, this effect seems to be mediated by the fact that co-learners provided with these objective cues become more accurate in estimating their partner's knowledge – accuracy that predicts higher outcomes. Analyses on the process level of the verbal interactions indicate that the KAT seems to sensitize co-learners to the fragile nature of their partner's as well as their own prior knowledge. The beneficial effect of the KAT seems to mainly rely on this induction of epistemic uncertainty that implicitly triggers compensation socio-cognitive strategies; strategies that appear to be beneficial to the learning process.},

  abstract = {For almost half a century, Paul Meehl educated psychologists about how the mindless use of null-hypothesis significance tests made research on theories in the social sciences basically uninterpretable. In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalizing procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and influential. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychological scientists have begun to realize that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound “derivation chain” between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various nonconfirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognized and incentivized as a crucial goal in itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to nonconfirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology's reform movement and help us to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged.},

Some stimuli are more relevant for our well-being and survival than others, for example stimuli that signal a threat or an opportunity for growth and expansion. In this review we examine the special role of such “emotional” stimuli in perception and categorisation. To this end, we first discuss some fundamental aspects of perception, with an emphasis on the cognitive process of categorisation. We then tackle the questions: “What is an emotional stimulus?” and “What is an emotion category?” Afterwards, we illustrate, with a review of key findings from the empirical literature, (i) how stimuli are categorised as emotional, and (ii) how the perceptual processing of emotional stimuli is prioritised to allow for a rapid preparation of adaptive responses. To conclude, we discuss how research on the perception of emotional stimuli can contribute to current debates in psychology, namely (i) about the role of bottom-up vs. top-down factors in emotional processing and experience, and (ii) about the nature of the relationship between cognition and emotion.},

  abstract = {For decades a somewhat narrow interpretation of Max Weber's emphasis on the rational nature of the bureaucratic organization (Albrow 1992; Putnam and Mumby 1993) has led organization theorists to keep their theorizing and research sterile-uncontaminated by the unsavory men-tion of emotion or affect. One of the reasons for avoiding affect is the long-standing philoso-phical tradition in which anything emotional is considerepassion' and hence a threat to rationality. Traces of these deep-seated atti-tudes can still be found in the rationalistic currents of the literature on organizational behavior and organizational learning (Flam 1990a, b). Ashforth and Humphrey (1995) ar-gued that rationalist thought has led to institu-tionalized mechanisms for regulating the experience and expression of emotion in the workplace, mechanisms such as neutralizing, buffering, prescribing, and normalizing emo-tion. Attacking these persistent beliefs, these authors showed that emotionality and ration-ality are interdependent, that emotions are an integral and inseparable part of organizational life, and that emotions are often functional for the organization. Effects of Emotion Scherer and Tran The discovery of emotion an important fac-tor in organizational processes is fairly recent. One of the ®rst milestones was the description of organizational feeling rules that require in-dividuals to engage in elaboratèemotion' work (Hochschild 1979, 1983) and the management of affect in the interest of the organization's aims. In the last decade, a number of authors writing about the role of emotion in speci®c work set-tings have highlighted both outward expres-sion and inner feeling as determined by role requirements or organizational and cultural norms (see Fineman 1996; Waldron 1994 for de-tailed reviews). In the following section, the implication that this literature has for organ-izational learning is summarized.},

We studied this issue with the help of two ERA tests drawn from two emotion portrayal corpora. In Study 1, we investigated the dimensional structure of ERA in a set of 10 emotions presented in four modalities (audio, video, still picture, audio-video). In Study 2, we investigated a set of 14 emotions in the audio-video modality. Our results suggest that ERA might be conceptualized as a broad ability consisting of related skills involved in the recognition of positive and negative emotions. In addition, correlated residuals between pairs of similar emotions (e.g., irritation and anger) suggest the existence of specific ability facets within the valence-based skill dimensions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Emotional intelligence (EI) has been frequently studied as a predictor of work criteria, but disparate approaches to defining and measuring EI have produced rather inconsistent findings. The conceptualization of EI as an ability to be measured with performance-based tests is by many considered the most appropriate approach, but only few tests developed in this tradition exist, and none of them is designed to specifically assess EI in the workplace. The present research introduces the Geneva Emotional Competence test (GECo)—a new ability EI test measuring emotion recognition (assessed using video clips of actors), emotion understanding, emotion regulation in oneself, and emotion management in others (all assessed with situational judgment items of work-related scenarios). For the situational judgment items, correct and incorrect response options were developed using established theories from the emotion and organizational field. Five studies (total N Ï­ 888) showed that all subtests had high measurement precision (as assessed with Item Response Theory), and correlated in expected ways with other EI tests, cognitive intelligence, personality, and demographic variables. Further, the GECo predicted performance in computerized assessment center tasks in a sample of professionals, and explained academic performance in students incrementally above another ability EI test. Because of its theory-based scoring, good psychometric properties, and focus on the workplace, the GECo represents a promising tool for studying the role of four major EI components in organizational outcomes.},

A detailed examination of the notion of replication reveals that there are many different meanings to this concept and the relevant procedures, but hardly any systematic literature. This paper analyzes the concept of replication from a theoretical point of view. It demonstrates that the theoretical demands are scarcely met in everyday work within the social sciences. Some demands are just not feasible, whereas others are constricted by restrictions relating to publication. A new classification scheme based on a functional approach that distinguishes between different types of replication is proposed. Next, it will be argued that replication addresses the important connection between existing and new knowledge. To do so it has to be applied explicitly and systematically. The paper ends with a description of procedures how this could be done and a set of recommendations how to handle the concept of replication in the future to exploit its potential to the full.},

EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

In the present study, participants responded to a standardized laboratory situation with a variety of different emotions.

What differentiates such group-level emotions from emotions that occur purely at the individual level? The authors argue that 4 key criteria define group-level emotions: Group emotions are distinct from the same person's individual-level emotions, depend on the person's degree of group identification, are socially shared within a group, and contribute to regulating intragroup and intergroup attitudes and behavior. Evidence from 2 studies supports all 4 of these predictions and thus points to the meaningfulness, coherence, and functionality of group-level emotions.},

Based on a 19 item Online Social Presence Questionnaire (OSPQ) given to college students in two different online learning courses, a series of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses consistently revealed five factors representing facets of social presence in online learning environments: social respect (e.g. receiving timely responses), social sharing (e.g., sharing information or expressing beliefs), open mind (e.g., expressing agreement or receiving positive feedback), social identity (e.g., being called by name), and intimacy (e.g., sharing personal experiences). Together, the five factors accounted for 58\% of the variance and were based on 19 items. Although much previous research focuses on cognitive aspects of learning in online environments, understanding the role of the learner's sense of presence may be particularly important in distance learning situations in which students and the instructor are physically separated.},

It is an appropriate time to ask: what central questions can integrate our work into a coherent field? This paper proposes the study of technology affordances for intersubjective meaning-making as an integrating research agenda for CSCL. A brief survey of epistemologies of collaborative learning and forms of computer support for that learning characterize the field to be integrated and motivate the proposal. A hybrid of experimental, descriptive and design methodologies is proposed in support of this agenda. A working definition of intersubjective meaning-making as joint composition of interpretations of a dynamically evolving context is provided, and used to propose a framework around which dialogue between analytic approaches can take place. 1},

" One form of reap-praisal is the reinterpretation of an emotionally evocative stimu-lus in order to alter its emotional impact (Gross, 1998a). In the examples of emotion regulation provided earlier, convincing ourselves a car accident isn't as bad as it looks is an attempt at reappraisal; we have initially appraised the wreck as potentially lethal or injurious to those involved and have reinterpreted the observed damage as hopefully cosmetic. Reappraisal has two major variations: " reinterpretation " wherein an evocative stimu-lus is reinterpreted to alter its emotional impact and " distanc-ing " wherein an individual reduces the relevance of an evocative stimulus to themselves. For this manuscript, we will be discuss-ing primarily the reinterpretation form of reappraisal though in any cases arguments will apply to both variants. In line with the domains of emotion effects listed before, engagement of reap-praisal through reinterpretation can alter subjective experience of an emotion as measured through self},

The main finding is that (benign) envy and admiration both lead to a motivation to improve oneself. This confirms earlier findings that admiration leads to a motivation to affiliate with the admired other and a motivation to improve one's own position. Furthermore, it supports the idea that envy can lead to both a motivation to improve oneself and a motivation to pull down the envied other, finding support for a subtypes theory of envy.},

How do group-level phenomena shape group members' emotional experience and expression? How are emotional expressions recognised, interpreted and shared in group settings?

To answer these and other questions, we draw on relevant theoretical perspectives (e.g., intergroup emotions theory, social appraisal theory and emotions as social information theory) and recent empirical findings regarding the role of emotions in groups. We organise our review according to two overarching themes: how groups shape emotions and how emotions shape groups. We show how novel empirical approaches break important new ground in uncovering the role of emotions in groups.

Social-functional approaches hold that these emotions in turn contribute to group functioning by prompting group members to address concerns that are relevant to the group's success. Guided by Emotions as Social Information (EASI) theory, this paper reviews research on the affective, cognitive, and behavioral consequences of emotional expressions in groups. Affective processes include emotional contagion and affective convergence, and resulting states such as group affective tone and affective diversity. Cognitive processes include inferences group members draw from each other's emotional expressions. We discuss how these affective and cognitive processes shape behavior and group functioning. We conclude that the traditional (over)emphasis on affective processes must be complemented with a focus on cognitive processes to develop a more complete understanding of the social dynamics of emotions in groups.},

Thus far the functions of emotions have been conceptualised and studied mainly at the intrapersonal level of analysis, the key question being how individuals are influenced by the emotions they experience.

Our analysis is informed by emotion as social information theory (EASI; Van Kleef, 2009).

We review supportive evidence from various domains of social influence, including negotiation, leadership, attitude change, compliance, and conformity in groups.

To address this question, I draw on research on the interpersonal effects of emotions on behavior in personal relationships, parent–child interactions, conflict, negotiation, and leadership, and propose a new framework that can account for existing findings and guide future research: the emotions as social information (EASI) model. I demonstrate that emotional expressions affect observers' behavior by triggering inferential processes and/or affective reactions in them. The predictive strength of these two processes—which may inspire different behaviors—depends on the observer's information processing and on social-relational factors. Examples of moderators that determine the relative predictive strength of inferences and affective reactions include power, need for cognitive closure, time pressure, display rules, and the appropriateness and target of the emotional expression, which are all discussed.},

Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a "space" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes–response-dependent and response-independent–that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on "pieces" of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.},

And he knows what we can do. {"}We have a crisis on our hands, and its victims are our children.{"} Marc Brackett is a professor in Yale University's Child Study Center and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. In his 25 years as an emotion scientist, he has developed a remarkably effective plan to improve the lives of children and adults ' a blueprint for understanding our emotions and using them wisely so that they help, rather than hinder, our success and well-being. The core of his approach is a legacy from his childhood, from an astute uncle who gave him permission to feel. He was the first adult who managed to see Marc, listen to him, and recognize the suffering, bullying, and abuse he'd endured. And that was the beginning of Marc's awareness that what he was going through was temporary. He wasn't alone, he wasn't stuck on a timeline, and he wasn't 'wrong' to feel scared, isolated, and angry. Now, best of all, he could do something about it. In the decades since, Marc has led large research teams and raised tens of millions of dollars to investigate the roots of emotional well-being. His prescription for healthy children (and their parents, teachers, and schools) is a system called RULER, a high-impact and fast-effect approach to understanding and mastering emotions that has already transformed the thousands of schools that have adopted it. RULER has been proven to reduce stress and burnout, improve school climate, and enhance academic achievement. This book is the culmination of Marc's development of RULER and his way to share the strategies and skills with readers around the world. It is tested, and it works. This book combines rigor, science, passion and inspiration in equal parts. Too many children and adults are suffering; they are ashamed of their feelings and emotionally unskilled, but they don't have to be. Marc Brackett's life mission is to reverse this course, and this book can show you how},

In the present study, we used a semantic profiling instrument (GRID) to investigate features representing five emotion components (appraisal, bodily reaction, expression, action tendencies, and feeling) of 11 emotion words in situational contexts involving success or failure. We compared these to the data from an earlier study in which participants evaluated the typicality of features out of context. Profile analyses identified features for which typicality changed as a function of context for all emotion words, except contentment, with appraisal features being most frequently affected. Those context effects occurred for both hypothesised basic and non-basic emotion words. Moreover, both data sets revealed a four-dimensional structure. The four dimensions were largely similar (valence, power, arousal, and novelty). The results suggest that context may not change the underlying dimensionality but affects facets of the meaning of emotion words.},

However, the measurement of these states has not progressed along with theory, such that when researchers measure subjectively experienced emotions, they commonly rely on scales assessing broad dimensions of affect (positivity and negativity), rather than discrete emotions. The current manuscript presents four studies that validate a new instrument, the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire (DEQ), that is sensitive to eight distinct state emotions: anger, disgust, fear, anxiety, sadness, happiness, relaxation, and desire. Emotion theory supporting the importance of distinguishing these specific emotions is reviewed.},

These methods were used in nine separate field experiments done in naturalistic settings. Based on our experiments, we can argue that all of these methods can be successfully used for collecting emotional responses to evaluate mobile applications in mobile settings. However, differences can be identified in the suitability of the methods for different research setups. Even though the self-report instruments provide a feasible alternative for evaluating emotions evoked by mobile applications, several challenges were identified, for example, in capturing the dynamic nature of mobile interaction usage situations and contexts.

Environments for computer-mediated collaboration need to trigger learning-productive interactions. In this paper, we propose to implement tools providing group knowledge awareness (GKA), i.e., information about collaborators' knowledge. GKA is typically restricted in CSCL environments. A GKA tool visualizing self-assessed learner knowledge, their partner's self-assessed knowledge, and thus the distribution of knowledge, was studied in a computer-mediated collaborative learning scenario. Thirty-eight dyads were randomly assigned to either the GKA condition (GKA tool) or a control condition (only learner's own knowledge was visualized). Results show that the GKA tool guided learners in their collaboration and, more specifically, in designing their communicative acts. Depending on the self- vs. partner-oriented purpose of the communicative act, the learner's own vs. the partner's knowledge guided communication. Guided communication was a mechanism for perceived learning gains and perceived knowledge convergence. A knowledge test failed to reveal a significant difference between the GKA and the control condition. In this paper, we will discuss characteristics of GKA tools and their impact on collaboration.},

One way to enhance the effectiveness of collaborative learning is to structure interactions by engaging students in well-defined scripts. A collaboration script is a set of instructions prescribing how students should form groups, how they should interact and collaborate and how they should solve the problem. In computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), the script is reified in the interface of the learning environment. This contribution dismantles the concept of script. Syntactically, a script is sequence of phases and each phase can be described by five attributes. The grammatical combination of these elements may however produce any kind of pedagogical method, even those that have nothing to do with the idea of collaborative learning. On the one hand, the definition of scripts constitutes a promising convergence between educational engineering and socio-cultural approaches but, on the other hand, it drifts away from the genuine notion of collaborative learning. Will the fun and the richness of group interactions survive to this quest for effectiveness? The answer depends on the semantics of collaborative scripts: what is the design rationale, what is the core mechanism in the script through which the script designer expects to foster productive interactions and learning? 1.},

With its 4 types of components of internal and external scripts (play, scene, role, and scriptlet) and 7 principles, this theory addresses the question of how CSCL practices are shaped by dynamically reconfigured internal collaboration scripts of the participating learners. Furthermore, it explains how internal collaboration scripts develop through participation in CSCL practices. It emphasizes the importance of active application of subject matter knowledge in CSCL practices, and it prioritizes transactive over nontransactive forms of knowledge application in order to facilitate learning. Further, the theory explains how external collaboration scripts modify CSCL practices and how they influence the development of internal collaboration scripts. The principles specify an optimal scaffolding level for external collaboration scripts and allow for the formulation of hypotheses about the fading of external collaboration scripts. Finally, the article points toward conceptual challenges and future research questions.},

Among other reasons, that the computation of Ï‰ is not available as an option in many popular statistics programs and requires items loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) have probably hindered more widespread adoption. After a bit of discussion of Î± versus Ï‰, we illustrate the computation of Ï‰ using two structural equation modeling programs (Mplus and AMOS) and the MBESS package for R. We then describe a macro for SPSS and SAS (OMEGA) that calculates Ï‰ in two ways without relying on the estimation of loadings or error variances using CFA. We show that it produces estimates of Ï‰ that are nearly identical to when using CFAbased estimates of item loadings and error variances. We also discuss the use of the OMEGA macro for certain forms of item analysis and brief form construction based on the removal of items from a longer scale.},

Several thousand respondents participated in an Internet survey that applied GEA to self-reported emotion experiences. Users recalled appraisals of emotion-eliciting events and labeled the experienced emotion with one or two words, generating a massive data set on realistic, intense emotions in everyday life. For a final sample of 5969 respondents we show that GEA achieves a high degree of predictive accuracy by matching a user's appraisal input to one of 13 theoretically predefined emotion prototypes. The first prediction was correct in 51\% of the cases and the overall diagnosis was considered as at least partially correct or appropriate in more than 90\% of all cases. These results support a component process model that encourages focused, hypothesis-guided research on elicitation and differentiation, memory storage and retrieval, and categorization and labeling of emotion episodes. We discuss the implications of these results for the study of emotion terms in natural language semantics.},

Results of Experiment 1 revealed that recognition of the target emotion of fear was improved when a subliminal angry contextual face gazed towardâ€”rather than away fromâ€”the fearful face. We replicated this effect in Experiment 2, in which facial expression blends of fear and surprise were more often and more rapidly categorized as expressing fear when the subliminal contextual face expressed anger and gazed towardâ€”rather than away fromâ€”the target face. With the contextual face appearing for 30 ms in total, including only 10 ms of emotion expression, and being immediately masked, our data provide the first evidence that social influence on emotion recognition can occur automatically.},

In this article, we report the results of five studies examining the testâ€™s construct validity with a total N of 1,284. We found that the GERT was highly positively correlated with other performance-based tests measuring ERA and emotional intelligence (EI), as well as with cognitive intelligence. GERT scores were also related to higher self-reported empathy, openness, and neuroticism, and to better social adjustment. Furthermore, higher GERT scores were related to lower anxiety, anger expressivity, and alexithymia. In line with previous findings, women scored higher than men and GERT performance declined with increasing age. Taken together, the...},

  abstract = {Researchers have traditionally studied emotion perception in terms of subjective feeling labels (e.g., â€œhappy,â€ â€œproudâ€). This paradigm is at odds with the common conceptual understanding of emotion as multi-componential, including also appraisals, psychophysiological activation, action tendencies, and motor expressions. The conclusions based on past emotion perception research might therefore be less generalizable than previously thought. Here we extend work by Yik and Russell (1999) and Scherer and Grandjean (2007) on the degree to which emotion percepts are multi-componential, by using more ecologically valid, dynamic, and multi-modal, stimuli, and a more methodologically sound response measure. The results demonstrate that the finding that observers can reliably infer multiple types of information (subjective feelings, appraisals, action tendencies, and social messages) from emotion expressions is robust to variation both in the perceptual characteristics of the expression, and in the response measure used to measure recognition. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for research on emotion perception.},

  abstract = {â€˜Valenceâ€™ is used in many different ways in emotion theory. It generally refers to the â€˜positiveâ€™ or â€˜negativeâ€™ character of an emotion, as well as to the â€˜positiveâ€™ or â€˜negativeâ€™ character of some aspect of emotion. After reviewing these different uses, I point to the conceptual problems that come with them. In particular, I distinguish: problems that arise from conflating the valence of an emotion with the valence of its aspects, and problems that arise from the very idea that an emotion (and/or its aspects) can be divided into mutually exclusive opposites. The first group of problems does not question the classic dichotomous notion of valence, but the second does. In order to do justice to the richness of daily emotions, emotion science needs more complex conceptual tools.},

In addressing these issues, new theoretical ideas are suggested and an update of recent research on the sequence of appraisal processes is provided.

  abstract = {The distinction between the positive and the negative is fundamental in our emotional life. In appraisal theories, in particular in the component process model of emotion (Scherer, 1984, 2010), qualitatively different types of valence are proposed based on appraisals of (un)pleasantness, goal obstructiveness/conduciveness, low or high power, self-(in)congruence, and moral badness/goodness. This multifaceted conceptualization of valence is highly compatible with the frequent observation of mixed feelings in real life. However, it seems to contradict the one-dimensional conceptualization of valence often encountered in psychological theories, and the notion of valence as a common currency used to explain choice behavior. Here, we propose a framework to integrate the seemingly disparate conceptualizations of multifaceted valence and one-dimensional valence by suggesting that valence should be conceived at different levels, micro and macro. Micro-valences correspond to qualitatively different types of evaluations, potentially resulting in mixed feelings, whereas one-dimensional macro-valence corresponds to an integrative {"}common currency{"} to compare alternatives for choices. We propose that conceptualizing levels of valence may focus research attention on the mechanisms that relate valence at one level (micro) to valence at another level (macro), leading to new hypotheses, and addressing various concerns that have been raised about the valence concept, such as the valence-emotion relation.},

The present article aims at drawing attention to two areas of research that devoted considerable efforts to the understanding of social behaviour: ethology and social psychology. With a long tradition in the study of animal signals, ethology and evolutionary biology have developed theoretical concepts to account for the functional significance of signalling. For example, the consideration of divergent selective pressures responsible for the evolution of signalling and social cognition emphasized the importance of two classes of indicators: informative cues and communicative signals. Social psychology, on the other hand, investigates emotional expression and interpersonal relationships, with a focus on the mechanisms underlying the production and interpretation of social signals and cues. Based on the theoretical considerations developed in these two fields, we propose a model that integrates the processing of perceivable individual features (social signals and cues) with contextual information, and we suggest that output of computer-based processing systems should be derived in terms of functional significance rather than in terms of absolute conceptual meaning.},

This study directly tested this proposal by asking participants to recognize dynamic facial expressions of emotion (fear, happiness, or anger in Experiment 1; fear, happiness, anger, or neutral in Experiment 2) in a target face presented at the center of a screen while a contextual face, which appeared simultaneously in the periphery of the screen, expressed an emotion (fear, happiness, anger) or not (neutral) and either looked at the target face or not. We manipulated gaze direction to be able to distinguish between a mere contextual effect (gaze away from both the target face and the participant) and a specific social appraisal effect (gaze toward the target face). Results of both experiments provided evidence for a social appraisal effect in emotion recognition, which differed from the mere effect of contextual information: Whereas facial expressions were identical in both conditions, the direction of the gaze of the contextual face influenced emotion recognition. Social appraisal facilitated the recognition of anger, happiness, and fear when the contextual face expressed the same emotion. This facilitation was stronger than the mere contextual effect. Social appraisal also allowed better recognition of fear when the contextual face expressed anger and better recognition of anger when the contextual face expressed fear.},

I argue that theories of emotion causation should ideally address the problems of elicitation, intensity, and differentiation. Each of these problems can be divided into a subquestion that asks about the relation between stimuli and emotions (i.e., the functional level of process description, cf. Marr, 1982) and a subquestion that asks about the mechanism and representations that intervene (i.e., the algorithmic level of process description). The overview reveals that theories of emotion causation sometimes differ with regard to the kind of process that they hold responsible for emotion causation. More precisely, they hold different assumptions regarding the conditions under which the process is supposed to operate (optimal versus suboptimal), the format of the representations involved (propositional versus perceptual), and the object or input of the central process (stimulus versus responses/experience). Further, the overview reveals that theories of emotion causation sometimes differ with regard to the level of process description that they focus on. Finally, the overview brings to light several similarities among the theories discussed.},

The influence of emotions on decision-making is largely ignored. The studies of decision-making in neurological patients who can no longer process emotional information normally suggest that people make judgments not only by evaluating the consequences and their probability of occurring, but also and even sometimes primarily at a gut or emotional level. Lesions of the ventromedial (which includes the orbitofrontal) sector of the prefrontal cortex interfere with the normal processing of {"}somatic{"} or emotional signals, while sparing most basic cognitive functions. Such damage leads to impairments in the decision-making process, which seriously compromise the quality of decisions in daily life. The aim of this paper is to review evidence in support of {"}The Somatic Marker Hypothesis,{"} which provides a systems-level neuroanatomical and cognitive framework for decision-making and suggests that the process of decision-making depends in many important ways on neural substrates that regulate homeostasis, emotion, and feeling. The implications of this theoretical framework for the normal and abnormal development of the orbitofrontal cortex are also discussed.},

This fact leads many to assume that emotion perception is given and proceeds independently of conceptual processes such as language. In this paper we suggest otherwise and offer the hypothesis that language functions as a context in emotion perception. We review a variety of evidence consistent with the language-as-context view and then discuss how a linguistically relative approach to emotion perception allows for intriguing and generative questions about the extent to which language shapes the sensory processing involved in seeing emotion in another person's face. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There is considerable evidence for conceptually basic emotion categories (e.g., ?anger,? ?fear?). These categories do not designate biologically basic emotions, but some forms of anger, fear, and so on that are biologically basic in a sense we will specify. Finally, two notions of psychological basic-ness are distinguished, and the evidence for them is evaluated. The framework we offer acknowledges the force of some of the objections to basic emotion theory whilst demonstrating that the notion of a basic emotion, once properly reformulated, is still of scientific value.},

We applied the system to a new corpus of acted emotion portrayals, examined its comprehensiveness and demonstrated intercoder reliability at three levels: (a) occurrence, (b) temporal precision, and (c) segmentation.

Emotion categories and appraisals were judged significantly more accurately and confidently than messages or action tendencies. These results do not support claims of primacy for message or action tendency views of facial expression. Based on a componential model of emotion it is suggested that judges can infer components from categories and vice versa.},

It has been highly influential, driving a number of empirical lines of research (e.g. in the context of facial expression detection, neuroimaging studies and evolutionary psychology). Nevertheless, BET has been criticized by philosophers, leading to calls for it to be jettisoned entirely (Colombetti 2014; Hufendiek 2016). This paper defuses those criticisms. In addition, it shows that we have good reason to retain BET. Finally, it reviews and puts to rest worries that BETâ€™s commitment to affect programs renders it outmoded. We propose that, with minor adjustments, BET can be avoid such criticism when conceived under a radically enactive account of emotions. Thus, rather than leaving BET behind, we show how its basic ideas can be revised, refashioned and preserved. Hence, we conclude, our new BET is still a good bet.},

In contrast, we suggest that the behavioral ecology view of facial displays, as an externalist and functionalist approach, resolves the quandaries and contradictions embedded in BETâ€™s precepts and extensions.},

The authors provide new evidence for this debate by using three-mode (People Ã— Adjectives Ã— Occasions) parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis to determine the appropriate axes (and hence constructs) for representing affective experiences. Unlike traditional factor analysis, with PARAFAC different orientations of the axes fit the data differently so it is possible to determine the best fitting axes. In Study 1, the authors assessed the extent to which the PARAFAC procedure was able recover the axes defining a two-dimensional factor space under different conditions. In both Study 2 (N = 112) and Study 3 (N = 349), undergraduate students rated their emotional states on a variety of occasions. The best fitting axes for two-dimensional affective space were Valence and Activation in both studies. Exploration of higher dimensional solutions in Study 3 revealed a three-factor solution that, in addition to an activation factor, supported the separation of positive and negative emotions.

While itâ€™s implicitly assumed that psychology operates in this manner, critical discussions claim that the field suffers from a lack of cumulative theory. To examine this paradox, we analysed research published in Psychological Science from 2009â€“2019 (N = 2,225). We found mention of 359 theories in-text, most were referred to only once. Only 53.66\% of all manuscripts included the word theory, and only 15.33\% explicitly claimed to test predictions derived from theories. We interpret this to suggest that the majority of research published in this flagship journal is not driven by theory, nor can it be contributing to cumulative theory building. These data provide insight into the kinds of research psychologists are conducting and raises questions about the role of theory in the psychological sciences.},

  abstract = {We present EMODASH, an interactive dashboard supporting tutorsâ€™ retrospective awareness of learnersâ€™ emotions in a video-conferencing learning environment. Socio-affective relationships play an important role in learning processes and learning outcomes, but they are harder to develop in online-learning. This can be explained by a lack of emotion awareness due to the asynchronous interactions, technical challenges, and tutorsâ€™ focus on properly conducting the learning activity and gearing towards pedagogical outcomes. We conducted an eightweek long field study with five professional tutors on how they used EMODASH while writing feedback to learners after language learning sessions. We found that EMODASH led tutors who were already sensitive to learnersâ€™ emotions to incorporate more affective elements in their reports, suggesting a stronger awareness of learnersâ€™ emotions. Tutors also wrote more formative and less summative feedback. Furthermore, our results suggest that glanceable visualizations of learnersâ€™ emotions may be preferred and sufficient to foster tutorsâ€™ awareness of learnersâ€™ emotions. Finally, the dashboard led tutors to reflect on the way they conduct their lessons, using learnersâ€™ positive emotions as a proxy evaluation of their teaching.},

They help to envision goals and challenges, open the mind to thoughts and problem-solving, protect health by fostering resiliency, create attachments to significant others, lay the groundwork for individual self-regulation, and guide the behaviour of groups, social systems, and nations. In spite of their many functions, however, positive emotions have been neglected by psychology. Until recently, psychology has focused on the dark side of human life. Psycho- pathological behaviour, negative emotions emanating from stress, and coping with stress and negative emotions have been studied extensively, whereas adaptive behaviour, positive emotions, and proactive coping did not receive that much attention (cf. Frydenberg 1997; Fredrickson 2001). Furthermore, traditional theories addressing the functions of positive emotions for cognition and behaviour have focused on negative effects of positive emotions, instead of their regulatory benefits (cf. Aspinwall 1998).},

  abstract = {Background: Emotional management is very important for patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Since these patients may experience strong negative emotions, it is highly desirable to develop an information technology solution for the relief of negative emotions. Recently, online health communities introduced a new design element called the virtual mood wall, which allows patients to express their emotions. We are interested in determining the association between the use of virtual mood wall and the relief of patientsâ€™ negative emotions. Objective: The main purpose of this work is to evaluate whether sharing oneâ€™s emotions on the virtual mood wall is associated with the relief of the patientâ€™s negative emotions. Methods: We used a secondary econometric analysis using transaction data from 2013 obtained from a leading online diabetes community in China, Sweet Home. A total of 572 patients were included. We compared the change in negative emotion from 1 month before to 1 month after the patientâ€™s initial post on the virtual mood wall. Multivariate regression and propensity score matching were used to estimate the effect of the virtual mood wall on the relief of patientsâ€™ negative emotions. Results: Posting on the virtual mood wall is significantly associated with the decrease of patientsâ€™ negative emotions (p {$<$} 0.001). The control variables included the initial negative emotion (p {$<$} 0.001), the summer (p {$<$} 0.05) and autumn (p {$<$} 0.05) season, and the volume of homepage visitors (p {$<$} 0.05), all of which are significantly associated with the relief of negative emotions. Conclusions: This study empirically validated the positive association between the online sharing of emotions and the relief of negative emotions. We demonstrated that information technology provided a channel for sharing emotions. The virtual mood wall is an effective design element to help patients with chronic disease to recover from their negative},

Two studies were designed to redress this imbalance. In each of these studies, both EI and coping styles were significantly related to academic achievement. In Study 1, 159 community college students completed the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and problem-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidant coping scales. Collectively, the coping variables significantly mediated the relationship between EI and grade point average (GPA) for Emotion Perception, Emotion Facilitation of Thought and Emotion Management (but not for Emotional Understanding). Problem-focused coping was the only single significant mediator, mediating the relationship between emotion management and GPA (but not other branches and GPA). In Study 2, 293 middle school students completed the Situational Test of Emotion Management for Youths (STEM-Y) and scales measuring the same three coping strategies. In this study, the coping variables again significantly mediated the relationship between emotion management and GPA. Once again, problem-focused coping was a significant mediator. Collectively, these results suggest that better educational outcomes might be achieved by targeting skills relating to emotion management and problem-focused coping. Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We begin by positioning AALTs in the complex ecology comprised of diverse phenomena and technologies in the cognitive, affective, learning, and computing sciences. This is followed by an overview of the major findings of a recent meta-analysis aimed at identifying a subset of learning-centered affective states that generalize across students, learning technologies, learning tasks, and experimental methodologies. We then turn our attention to the two major types of AALTs: reactive systems that respond to affect once it occurs and proactive systems that aim to induce or impede certain affective states. Affective AutoTutor, GazeTutor, and UNC-ITSpoke are presented as examples of reactive AALTs, while Crystal Island and ConfusionTutor are included as examples of proactive AALTs. Some of the open issues in the area of AALTs are discussed. These include scalability for real-world contexts, good-enough classification accuracy, and levels of analysis for affective responding. The chapter concludes by outlining two broad avenues of research for the field.},

Although many AC researchers have traditionally attempted to remain agnostic to the different emotion theories proposed by psychologists, the affective technologies being developed are rife with theoretical assumptions that impact their effectiveness. Hence, an informed and integrated examination of emotion theories from multiple areas will need to become part of computing practice if truly effective real-world systems are to be achieved. This survey discusses theoretical perspectives that view emotions as expressions, embodiments, outcomes of cognitive appraisal, social constructs, products of neural circuitry, and psychological interpretations of basic feelings. It provides meta-analyses on existing reviews of affect detection systems that focus on traditional affect detection modalities like physiology, face, and voice, and also reviews emerging research on more novel channels such as text, body language, and complex multimodal systems. This survey explicitly explores the multidisciplinary foundation that underlies all AC applications by describing how AC researchers have incorporated psychological theories of emotion and how these theories affect research questions, methods, results, and their interpretations. In this way, models and methods can be compared, and emerging insights from various disciplines can be more expertly integrated.},

  abstract = {Although providing feedback is commonly practiced in education, there is no general agreement regarding what type of feedback is most helpful and why it is helpful. This study examined the relationship between various types of feedback, potential internal mediators, and the likelihood of implementing feedback. Five main predictions were developed from the feedback literature in writing, specifically regarding feedback features (summarization, identifying problems, providing solutions, localization, explanations, scope, praise, and mitigating language) as they relate to potential causal mediators of problem or solution understanding and problem or solution agreement, leading to the final outcome of feedback implementation. To empirically test the proposed feedback model, 1,073 feedback segments from writing assessed by peers was analyzed. Feedback was collected using SWoRD, an online peer review system. Each segment was coded for each of the feedback features, implementation, agreement, and understanding. The correlations between the feedback features, levels of mediating variables, and implementation rates revealed several significant relationships. Understanding was the only significant mediator of implementation. Several feedback features were associated with understanding: including solutions, a summary of the performance, and the location of the problem were associated with increased understanding; and explanations of problems were associated with decreased understanding. Implications of these results are discussed.},

  abstract = {The link between affect and student learning has been the subject of increasing attention in recent years. Because of the possible impacts of affective state on learning, it is a goal of many intelligent tutoring systems to attempt to control student emotional states through affective interventions. While much work has gone into improving the quality of these interventions, we are only beginning to understand the complexities of the relationships between affect, learning, and feedback. This paper investigates the consequences associated with providing affective feedback. It represents a first step toward the long-term objective of designing intelligent tutoring systems that can utilize this information for analysis of the risks and benefits of affective intervention. It reports on the results of two studies that were conducted with students interacting with affect-informed virtual agents. The studies reveal that emotion-specific risk/reward information is associated with particular affective states and suggests that future systems might leverage this information to make determinations about affective interventions.},

This study presents, summarizes, and analyzes the results of 145 experiments that used communication mode as an independent variable. The results show that the modal outcome for GSSs compared to Face-to-Face (FtF) methods is {"}no difference,{"} while the overall percentage of positive effects for results that compare GSS to FtF is 29.2\%. The results suggest that the use of a GSS improves decision quality, depth of analysis, equality of participation, and satisfaction over manual methods. Additionally, more detailed analysis suggests that task type, GSS type and the interaction of both have a moderating effect on adaptation and outcome factors. Specifically, groups working on idea generation tasks using GSS decision room technology improve to 39.6\% (GSS{$>$}FtF) effect. Conversely, asynchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) groups working on decision making tasks improved to 46.4\% (GSS{$>$}FtF) effect. FtF groups show higher levels of consensus and perceived quality, communicate more, and are more efficient (requiring less time to complete the tasks). No differences are observed between FtF and GSS groups on satisfaction and usability. Â© 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An analysis of the studies on social presence is accomplished leading to the development and validation of an instrument to measure social presence in the computer-mediated communication environment.

The results indicate that social presence contains three dimensions, social context, online communication, and interactivity and, privacy.},

As we will see in this essay, such a simple statement conceals considerable complexity. The interplay of learning with technology turns out to be quite intricate. The inclusion of collaboration, computer mediation and distance education has problematized the very notion of learning and called into question prevailing assumptions about how to study it. Like many active fields of scientific research, CSCL has a complex relationship to established disciplines, evolves in ways that are hard to pinpoint and includes important contributions that seem incompatible. The field of CSCL has a long history of controversy about its theory, methods and definition. Furthermore, it is important to view CSCL as a vision of what may be possible with computers and of what kinds of research should be conducted, rather than as an established body of broadly accepted laboratory and classroom practices. We will start from some popular understandings of the issues of CSCL and gradually reveal its more complex nature. We will review CSCLâ€™s historical development and offer our perspective on its future},

This work aims at a new theoretical perspective to the notion of presence. Indeed, it differs with the English speaking North American model of Community of Inquiry in e-learning. However, these two perspectives have in common to be based on the principle that presence is created by certain forms of social interactions between students, between teacher and learners when they are engaged in a distance collaborative approach. First, the article suggests a definition of the presence in e-learning while specifying the essential theoretical and epistemological positions that helped us to construct this definition. Then it explains the three dimensions that we attribute to the presence: i.e. the cognitive presence, the socio-emotional presence and the pedagogical presence. It defines each of those dimensions and shows their articulation. Finally, the article concludes on the limitations but also on the openings of this work to develop a model for presence in e-learning.},

We identified 252 reports from 2000â€”2008 that referenced the framework, and we reviewed them using Ogawan and Malen's (1991) strategy for synthesizing multi-vocal bodies of literature. Of the 252 reports, 48 collected and analyzed data on one or more aspects of the CoI framework; only five included a measure of student learning. Predominantly, learning was defined as perceived learning and assessed with a single item on a closed-form survey. Concerns about the soundness of such measures pervade the educational measurement community; in addition, we question the validity of the particular items employed in the CoI literature. Bracketing these concerns, the review indicates that it is unlikely that deep and meaningful learning arises in CoI. Students associate the surface learning that does occur with independent activities or didactic instruction; not sustained communication in critical CoI. We encourage researchers to conduct more, substantial investigations into the central construct of the popular framework for e-learning and theorists to respond to the mounting body of disconfirming evidence.},

Simple affordance corresponds to Gibsonâ€™s original formulation, while complex affordances embody such things as history and practice. In trying to account for complex affordance, two contrasting, but complementary philosophical treatments are considered. The first of these is Ilyenkovâ€™s account of significances which he claims are â€˜idealâ€™ phenomena. Ideal phenomena occupy are objective characteristics of things and are the product of human purposive activity. This makes them objective, but not independent (of any particular mind or perception) hence their similarity to affordances.},

The concept is important because it affects participation and social interaction, both necessary for effective collaboration and knowledge construction. This article reports on the construction and validation of a self-reporting (Dutch-language) Social Presence Scale to determine perceived social presence in distributed learning groups using computer-supported collaborative learning environments. The result is a one-dimensional scale consisting of five items with an internal consistency of .81. We used a nomological network of similar constructs for further validation. The findings suggest that the Social Presence Scale has potential to be useful as a measure for social presence.},

Researchers from the Human-Computer Interaction field employ several different methods to measure altered emotions and collecting data about usersâ€™ subjective feeling is one of them. However, there is a lack of experimental studies that compare the different instruments used to evaluate these feelings. This paper carries out an investigation with four instruments â€“ a set of emojis, the SelfAssessment Manikin, scroll sliders and Semantic Emotional Space â€“ to find out which provides information about a subjective feeling that is closest to an emotion that has already been pre-classified by the literature for a given stimulus. The experiments involved 29 volunteers taking part in four experimental rounds. In each round, a volunteer watched a movie or part of a video clip and later randomly interacted with one of the instruments in a user interface. The results suggested that the scroll slider leads to a greater proximity to the pre-classified emotions.},

  abstract = {Researchers have theoretically proposed that humans decode other individualsâ€™ emotions or elementary cognitive appraisals from particular sets of facial action units (AUs). However, only a few empirical studies have systematically tested the relationships between the decoding of emotions/appraisals and sets of AUs, and the results are mixed. Furthermore, the previous studies relied on facial expressions of actors and no study used spontaneous and dynamic facial expressions in naturalistic settings. We investigated this issue using video recordings of facial expressions filmed unobtrusively in a real-life emotional situation, specifically loss of luggage at an airport. The AUs observed in the videos were annotated using the Facial Action Coding System. Male participants (n = 98) were asked to decode emotions (e.g., anger) and appraisals (e.g., suddenness) from facial expressions. We explored the relationships between the emotion/appraisal decoding and AUs using stepwise multiple regression analyses. The results revealed that all the rated emotions and appraisals were associated with sets of AUs. The profiles of regression equations showed AUs both consistent and inconsistent with those in theoretical proposals. The results suggest that (1) the decoding of emotions and appraisals in facial expressions is implemented by the perception of set of AUs, and (2) the profiles of such AU sets could be different from previous theories.},

  abstract = {While artificial neural networks are regularly employed in modeling the perception of facial and vocal emotion expression as well as in automatic expression decoding by artificial agents, this approach is yet to be extended to the modeling of emotion elicitation and differentiation. In part, this may be due to the dominance of discrete and dimensional emotion models, which have not encouraged computational modeling. This situation has changed with the advent of appraisal theories of emotion and a number of attempts to develop rule-based models can be found in the literature. However, most of these models operate at a high level of conceptual abstraction and rarely include the underlying neural architecture. In this contribution, an appraisal-based emotion theory, the Component Process Model (CPM), is described that seems particularly suited to modeling with the help of artificial neural network approaches. This is due to its high degree of specificity in postulating underlying mechanisms including efferent physiological and behavioral manifestations as well as to the possibility of linking the theoretical assumptions to underlying neural architectures and dynamic processes. This paper provides a brief overview of the model, suggests constraints imposed by neural circuits, and provides examples on how the temporal unfolding of emotion can be conceptualized and experimentally tested. In addition, it is shown that the specific characteristics of emotion episodes can be profitably explored with the help of non-linear dynamic systems theory.},

We argue that conscious experiences, regardless of their content, arise from one system in the brain. In this view, what differs in emotional and nonemotional states are the kinds of inputs that are processed by a general cortical network of cognition, a network essential for conscious experiences. Although subcortical circuits are not directly responsible for conscious feelings, they provide nonconscious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences. In building the case for this proposal, we defend a modified version of what is known as the higher-order theory of consciousness.},

Stevensâ€™ scales or â€œlevelsâ€ of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio), and of his rules setting out which statistical analyses are admissible with each measurement level. Many are nevertheless left confused about the basis of these rules, and whether they should be rigidly followed. In this article, I attempt to provide an accessible explanation of the measurement-theoretic concerns that led Stevens to argue that certain types of analyses are inappropriate with data of particular levels of measurement. I explain how these measurement-theoretic concerns are distinct from the statistical assumptions underlying data analyses, which rarely include assumptions about levels of measurement. The level of measurement of observations can nevertheless have important implications for statistical assumptions. I conclude that researchers may find it more useful to critically investigate the plausibility of the statistical assumptions underlying analyses than to limit themselves to the set of analyses that Stevens believed to be admissible with data of a given level of measurement.},

In this study, the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire for children (Rieffe, Meerum Terwogt, Petrides, et al., 2007), developed to measure the key aspects of emotion awareness, was improved conceptually and shortened to a 30-item version. First, the former scale Acting Out (the blunt expression of emotions) previously failed to uniquely contribute to the prediction of internalising symptoms and was therefore replaced by the scale Not Hiding (the tendency not to keep oneâ€™s emotion experiences hidden from others), which is theoretically more relevant to internalising symptoms. Second, items that did not load on the intended factor were omitted from the questionnaire. The outcomes from a sample of 665 children and young adolescents showed good psychometric properties and good criterion validity with the related measure for emotional self-efficacy, the TEIQue. Additionally, good concurrent validity was established with respect to common internalising problems during childhood and adolescence: somatic complaints, social anxiety, depression and a tendency for non-productive thinking (worry and rumination).},

We describe the development of an instrument that objectively measures this ability on the basis of actor portrayals of dynamic expressions of 10 emotions (2 variants each for 5 emotion families), operationalized as recognition accuracy in 4 presentation modes combining the visual and auditory sense modalities (audio/video, audio only, video only, still picture). Data from a large validation study, including construct validation using related tests (Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity; Rosenthal, Hall, DiMatteo, Rogers, \& Archer, 1979; Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion; Biehl et al., 1997; Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy; Nowicki \& Duke, 1994; Emotion Recognition Index; Scherer \& Scherer, 2008), are reported. The results show the utility of a test designed to measure both coarse and fine-grained emotion differentiation and modality-specific skills. Factor analysis of the data suggests 2 separate abilities, visual and auditory recognition, which seem to be largely independent of personality dispositions.},

  abstract = {This paper advances our knowledge of emotions in virtual teams using text-based computer-mediated communication. The literature's preoccupation with the absence of physical cues of emotion has meant we lack both an understanding of how emotions are co-constructed through interaction and an explanation of their role in the social relations of virtual teams. Adopting a communicative view of emotion, we present the findings of a longitudinal study of a virtual team within a transnational collaborative project. We present three aspects of interaction that demonstrate how team members' experience and understanding of the emotions expressed through, and suppressed from, text-based messages are influenced by the styles and patterns of interaction enabled by technology. Where our three aspects tend towards stasis, we argue that emotion provides a temporal dimension to a process of â€˜spatialisingâ€™ social relations by connoting what should change, or what should endure, between people.},

  abstract = {Emotions have a strong impact on learning processes and regulation strategies. Increasing learners' awareness on their own emotions and group ones, has the potential to significantly improve learning processes. However, the collection of emotional data is challenging, especially in ecological contexts like distance learning and MOOCs. The lack of generic methods and tools for emotional data collection is a crucial issue for the research community. In this paper we present two self-reporting tools we have developed for distance learning. EMORE-L enables to collect emotions from learners through a focused daily questionnaire. CATE supports emotions sharing via emoticons associated to annotations in documents. We conducted two studies in the same Psychology curriculum to compare the type, the number and the co-occurence of emotions reported by learners with each tool. We discuss the differences we observed according to the tool and to the learning situation, so as to bring researchers and practitioners with a list of factors that may influence the emotional data collection process.},

In this paper, we discuss the role of emotions in collaboration and present a concept of the prototype aimed at enriching collaborative remote groups with emotional awareness which can in turn potentially lead to increased intragroup trust and increased performance. The main difference of the presented system from similar ones is that it makes use of inobtrusive and robust emotions measurement and representation based on brain activity. We provide a short overview of related works and further directions.},

  abstract = {Most computer models for the automatic recognition of emotion from nonverbal signals (e.g., facial or vocal expression) have adopted a discrete emotion perspective, i.e., they output a categorical emotion from a limited pool of candidate labels. The discrete perspective suffers from practical and theoretical drawbacks that limit the generalizability of such systems. The authors of this chapter propose instead to adopt an appraisal perspective in modeling emotion recognition, i.e., to infer the subjective cognitive evaluations that underlie both the nonverbal cues and the overall emotion states. In a first step, expressive features would be used to infer appraisals; in a second step, the inferred appraisals would be used to predict an emotion label. The first step is practically unexplored in emotion literature. Such a system would allow to (a) link models of emotion recognition and production, (b) add contextual information to the inference algorithm, and (c) allow detection of subtle emotion states.},
