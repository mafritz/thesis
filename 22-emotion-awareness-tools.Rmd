## Definition of Emotional Awareness in Computer-Mediated Learning Environments

Emotional awareness in computer-mediated learning environments is often proposed in the literature as self-explaining or defined somehow implicitly. For instance, as stated in the previous chapter, Feidakis and colleagues [-@feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016, p. 217] define emotion awareness, mainly from a *technical* viewpoint, as "the *implicit* or *explicit collection of emotion data* and the *recognition* of *emotion patterns*" (italics in the text). Cernea and colleagues [-@cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015], in their overview of rising technologies in emotion-enhanced interaction, identifies the category of affective-aware systems as "designed to improve affective self-awareness of a user (i.e.,internal affective awareness) or awareness of the emotions of other users (i.e.,external affective awareness)" (*ibid.*, p.78). More precise definitions are provided by Lavoué and colleagues [-@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020], which are partially derived from clinical psychology. They first definition provied by Lavoué and colleagues is based upon @bodenFacetsEmotionalAwareness2015, which identifies emotional awareness as "the ability to perceive, identify, and understand emotions" [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020, p. 270]. Later in their article, Lavoué and colleagues (*ibid.*) propose another definition, based upon Rieffe and colleagues [-@rieffeEmotionAwarenessInternalising2008], referring to emotional awareness as "the attentional process by which individuals identify, explain and differentiate between their own emotions as well as the others' emotions" [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020, p. 270]. These two definitions resonate with socio-emotional competences briefly illustrated in the previous chapter. Finally, later in the same article, Lavoué and colleagues (*ibid.*) provide a more technical definition of emotion awareness tools: "[e]motion awareness tools can be defined as tools that display information on own' own [sic] or partners' emotions, circumstances and antecedents" [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020, p. 284]. Compared to the more abstract definition in Feidakis and colleagues or in Cernea and colleagues (*ibid.*), the definition in Lavoué and colleagues (*ibid.*) implies that the tool shall also provide information about circumstances and antecedents.

From these definitions it is possible to extrapolate three fundamental assumptions about emotional awareness and, by extension, the instrumentality of an EAT:

1. Learners may benefit from intra-personal emotional awareness by using information about their own emotions as valuable information for their own learning processes (self-regulation).
2. Learners may benefit from inter-personal emotional awareness by using information about their partners' emotions and/or by letting their own emotions known to their partners and/or by a combination of the two. One or all of these circumstances may contribute to learners' own learning processes (self-regulation), the learning processes of their partners individually (co-regulation), or the learning processes of the group as a whole (socially shared regulation).
3. Learners may benefit from emotional awareness conveyed by a dedicated tool, which *encodes* emotional information into the computer-mediated learning environment (expressing-displaying function), and *decodes* that information (perceiving-monitoring function), for learners to extrapolate emotional meaning-making instrumental to learning processes.

Each assumption is discussed in the following three sections. Every section proposes an overview of related theories, as well a selection of related works section, which are of particular interest for the present contribution in terms of objectives, methodologies, and findings.

## Emotional Awareness at the Intra-Personal Level

The first assumption about the instrumentality of emotional awareness implies that learners can benefit from it at the individual, intra-personal level.

### Theoretical Underpinnings

The role of emotion at the individual and intra-personal level has received over the last few decades extensive consideration from different perspectives and using different methods of investigation. A widespread consensus has emerged over the years about the fact that emotion, rather then disruptive of behavior and in antithesis with cognition, plays a prominent role in helping the organism to cope with a complex environment [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @armonyCambridgeHandbookHuman2013; @damasioDescartesError2006; @damasioStrangeOrderThings2018; @schererEmotionTheoriesConcepts2009; @immordino-yangEmotionsLearningBrain2016; @levensonAutonomicNervousSystem2014; @levensonIntrapersonalFunctionsEmotion1999; @leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987; @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013]. 

For instance, emotion is known to influence high-level cognitive functions such as attention, perception, memory, and decision-making [@broschImpactEmotionPerception2013], which are all implicated in learning processes. A large body of research suggests that a dedicated system to emotional attention may complement and interact with the exogenous and endogenous systems [@broschAdditiveEffectsEmotional2011]. Emotionally charged stimuli are also known to often bestow precedence in perception over non emotionally-charged stimuli [@broschPerceptionCategorisationEmotional2010]. Many links between emotion and memory have been established both in the encoding and retrieving of information [@sharotHowArousalModulates2004; @kensingerRetrievalEmotionalEvents2020], which may have important consequences for learning [@beegeMoodaffectCongruencyExploring2018; @tyngInfluencesEmotionLearning2017]. Finally, it has been determined that when emotion is not taken into account in decision-making, consequences can be highly disruptive for the person, since emotion may inform decision-making in functional terms [@becharaRoleEmotionDecisionmaking2004; @rollsEmotionDecisionmakingExplained2014]. 

Emotional awareness, though, goes a step forward in considering the importance of emotion at the intra-personal level, because it presupposes that learners can benefit from being aware of their emotions, adding therefore an additional layer of conscious information processing [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020]. Whether consciousness is a necessary condition for emotion to *exist* [@ledouxHigherorderTheoryEmotional2017; @liebermanBooConsciousnessProblem2019] is a debate outside the scope of the present contribution (see also next chapter): the use of voluntary self-report requires consciousness for emotional awareness to emerge in the first place and therefore *dodges* the issue. Conscious processing derived from emotional awareness has been related more specifically to three overlapping factors in learning processes [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020]: (1) emotion as useful information to direct or redirect cognitive resources; (2) emotion as useful information to assess and guide learners' interest and motivation; and (3) emotion as useful information to regulate one's own behavior, including one's own emotions. 

Learners may use their achievement, epistemic and topic emotions as useful cues to evaluate and direct cognitive processes [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2014]. The work of D'Mello and colleagues [-@dmelloConfusionCanBe2014], for instance, highlights how confusion is a signal of cognitive disequilibrium, which learners are therefore incited to re-balance. The work of Vogl and colleagues [-@voglSurpriseCuriosityConfusion2019] about the role of epistemic emotions suggests that experience of curiosity, pride and shame may inform learners about different reasons for knowledge exploration.

Awareness of one's emotions may prompt learners to assess their motivation to keep engaged or disengage from a learning activity [@linnenbrink-garciaAdaptiveMotivationEmotion2016]. For instance, Baker and colleagues' work [-@bakerBetterBeFrustrated2010] draws attention on the importance of recognizing boredom and frustration as warnings of inefficient and potentially misleading efforts. 

Finally, emotion may be used as useful information to regulate one's own behavior, including emotion regulation itself [@grossEmotionRegulationCurrent2015; @grossHandbookEmotionRegulation2014]. When performed explicitly rather than implicitly [@torrePuttingFeelingsWords2018], emotion regulation requires the person to be aware of the emotion to be regulated [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020]. According to Gross, "[e]motion regulation refers to the processes by which we influence which emotions we have, when we have them, and how we experience and express them" [@grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002, p. 282]. The process model of emotion regulation [@grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @grossEmotionRegulationCurrent2015] posits that regulation can happen at five successive stages: (1) *situation selection*, which consists in avoiding or experiencing events according to their probability of eliciting unwanted or sought after emotions; (2) *situation modification*, consisting in attuning the situation once it has been selected or it is forced upon the person; (3) *attentional deployment*, by which some characteristics of the situation are considered more relevant than others; (4) *cognitive change*, through which the focal points of the situation can be reappraised in an attempt to shift, prolong or increase an emotional experience; and finally (5) *response modulation*, which occurs once an emotion has already been elicited and the person attempts, for instance, to suppress its manifestations (*e.g.*, trying not to shake during and oral exam or suppressing a laughter during a lesson). The fourth and fifth passages have been often considered as two alternative strategies for emotion regulation, with potentially different impact on person's cognition and behavior [@bonannoImportanceBeingFlexible2004; @grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @richardsEmotionRegulationMemory2000]. In some circumstances, cognitive change can be more beneficial, since it reassesses the situation in what shall be more favorable terms for the person, freeing resources that would otherwise be monopolized by the undesired emotion [@richardsEmotionRegulationMemory2000]. In other circumstances, a cognitive re-evaluation of the situation may be too demanding, and the person may have more benefits in trying to suppress the response modulation [@bonannoImportanceBeingFlexible2004]. 

Torre and Lieberman [-@torrePuttingFeelingsWords2018], on the other hand, hypothesize that emotion regulation may occur even implicitly through *affect labeling* [@liebermanAffectLabelingAge2019; @liebermanPuttingFeelingsWords2007; @liebermanSubjectiveResponsesEmotional2011], that is, when people assign a word to the their emotional experience (*e.g.* "I feel angry"). In their article, the authors provide an overview of research about affect labeling and state that it "has demonstrated a modulation of emotional output effects in the same experiential, autonomic, neural, and behavioral domains as found in other forms of emotion regulation" [@torrePuttingFeelingsWords2018, p. 117]. The authors also highlight, though, that the mechanisms by which affect labeling intervene as implicit emotion regulation are still unclear. In this regard, Torre and Lieberman (*ibid*.) propose four possible mechanisms: (1) *distraction*, for resorting to language shift the attention from the situation itself and therefore attenuates full processing of the eliciting event; (2) *self-reflection*, as a means to initiate an introspection process fostering self-distancing from the emotion; (3) *reduction of uncertainty*, which results from categorizing an intense and often nuanced experience using known and community-shared words; and (4) *symbolic conversion*, consisting in events assuming symbolic status through the associated word, which may induce more abstract thinking about the eliciting event. Each of the proposed mechanisms, though, has advantages and limitations in explaining how affect labeling may produce emotion regulation, which therefore needs further investigation. 

To sum up, emotional awareness may therefore be useful either as explicit [@grossEmotionRegulationCurrent2015] or implicit [@torrePuttingFeelingsWords2018] emotion regulation. It may also help learners in evaluating whether a regulatory strategy may be more or less appropriate given the situation at hand [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020].

Molinari and colleagues [-@molinariEMORELOutilReporting2016] developed a self-reporting system from an experience sampling method [@csikszentmihalyiValidityReliabilityExperienceSampling2014] perspective, the EMORE-L (EMOtion REport for E-Learning), which was used in an ecological setting by 16 university students who voluntarily adopted the system during 15 days of distance learning in a blended bachelor program. The system consists in a short online questionnaire that students were reminded to fill once per day through an email that they received at a time previously concerted with the investigators. The EMORE-L consists in nine short questions, which are meant to reduce the amount of time needed to fill-in the questionnaire, organized in 4 parts: a first part about the situation the students were facing, a second part about the cognitive evaluation of the situation, a third part about the emotional experience, and a last part about the social sharing of emotion. The nine questions (in french in the study) as well as the part they belong to are the following:

1. (Situation) Whether students were working on their courses of the bachelor program, with possible answers (a) *no, and I don't think to*, (b) *no, but I am thinking about it*, and (c) *yes*.
2. (Situation) A description of what students were doing, with an open-ended question.
3. (Cognitive evaluation) To what extent students felt in control over their current activity, with a 7-point scale going from *not at all* to *yes, absolutely*
4. (Cognitive evaluation) To what extent they considered the activity as useful, on the same scale as the previous item. The two items clearly refer to Control-Value theory [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006], explicitly adopted by Molinari and colleagues as part of their theoretical framework.
5. (Cognitive evaluation) To what extent students considered to take part actively to the situation, once again on the same 7-point scale as the two previous items.
6. (Emotion) Which emotion students were feeling and with what intensity. Students were provided with a list of 8 discrete emotions, chosen for they prevalent frequency in learning situations based on the literature (*pleasure*, *anxiety*, *curiosity*, *boredom*, *engagement*, *confusion*, *surprise*, and *frustration*), plus a neutral point. Students could check one or more cases corresponding to the emotions they felt. Each emotional word conveniently provided a description of the term via a *hover-effect*. The intensity was assessed with a 1-to-7 point scale proportional to the perceived intensity of the emotion experienced.
7. (Sharing) To what extent students wished to share their emotions with their colleagues, on a 7-point scale.
8. (Sharing) To what extent students thought to know the emotions experienced by their colleagues, on a 7-point scale.
9. (Sharing) To what extent students thought their own emotions were known by their colleagues, always on a 7-point scale.

Through the 169 questionnaire that were filled throughout the 15 days, Molinari and colleagues (*ibid.*) were able to exploratory assess three main subjects. For each element, the authors used results of the study to discuss consequences on the implementation of emotion self-reporting tool in a context of emotional awareness.

The first subject under scrutiny concerned what emotions were most frequently associated with the different situations a student may encounter during distance learning. In this regard, results highlight four main activities, ordered from the most frequent: reading resources, synthesis of the same resources, individual work, and group work. The three most likely emotion to be experience are *pleasure*, *anxiety*, and *surprise*, whereas students made a scant use of the other five emotions proposed by the list. The authors also evinced from their data that the frequency of emotion changed as a function of the activity. On this ground, Molinari and colleagues suggest that self-report tool should take into account the specific activity that they aim to sustain, avoiding thus generic list of emotions.

The second phenomenon explored in the study was to what extent students wished to share their emotions with their colleagues, and in what situation. According to their results, Molinari and colleagues posit that students prefer to share their emotions during individual and group works. Furthermore, students were also more inclined to share their emotions when they experienced *anxiety* or *pleasure*. Based on these results, the author suggest that self-reporting tools shall not be provided at all time, but only when the activity is likely to elicit emotions learners wish to share. 

Finally, Molinari and colleagues assessed the contribution of the dimensional approach of the cognitive evaluation items and of the eight discrete emotions in allowing students to express what they felt. The dimensional vs. discrete emotion approach to emotion self-reporting is in fact a longstanding debate [@mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005], with both approaches presenting advantages and shortcomings both in terms of user experience and quality of data. Results observed by Molinari and colleagues, augmented by feedbacks from students regarding the use of the system, confirm this trend. For instance, the authors highlight the scant use of the different discrete emotions, with only three out of eight being adopted frequently. At the same time, the cognitive evaluation provided through the *control*, *value* and *activation* dimensions also presented shortcomings: *pleasure*, *anxiety* and *surprise*, in spite of their diversity, were in fact associated to similar appraisal profiles. On this ground, the authors point out how important it is that the self-reporting system helps students in identifying their emotional experience.

Molinari and colleagues (*ibid*) exploratory work provide useful elements with respect to emotional awareness in a voluntary self-reporting setting. On the technical standpoint, the EMORE-L combines antecedents of emotions in the form of cognitive evaluation, with emotional experience expressed with natural language word, even though the two blocks of items are not intertwined in the user experience. Furthermore, Molinari and colleagues introduced emotional awareness in individual settings, as a means to provide students with self-awareness of their own emotions, but at the same time measured students' wish to dispose of collective emotional awareness. To this extent, the authors underline how students expressed the wish to have full control over when and which emotional information to disclose. Furthermore, they also manifested the wish of being aware of their colleagues emotions, that is, bringing emotional awareness at the inter-personal level, which is the subject of the next section.

## Emotional Awareness at the Inter-Peronal Level

The second assumption about the instrumentality of emotional awareness posits that learners can benefit from emotional information available at a collective level, either for their own learning processes, that of their partners, or both at the same time.

### Theoretical Underpinnings

Whereas the intra-personal function of emotion has received extensive attention in the last few decades, several researchers have more recently advocated the need for investigating the inter-personal function of emotion [@parkinsonEmotionSocialRelations2005; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018; @fischerWhereHaveAll2010]. Fisher and Van Kleef [-@fischerWhereHaveAll2010], for instance, posit that

> [i]t is an indisputable fact that emotions are mostly reactions to other people, that emotions take place in settings where other people are present, that emotions are expressed towards other people and regulated because of other people. It is hardly possible to imagine the elicitation of anger, shame, sadness, happiness, envy, guilt, contempt, love, or hatred without imagining other people as cause, target, or third-party observer of these emotions. In other words, the social constitution of emotions is beyond doubt -- @fischerWhereHaveAll2010, p. 208.

Keltner and Haidt [-@keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999] identify four level of analysis in which emotion play a social function: (1) the individual level, whenever the source of the emotion is of a social nature; (2) the dyadic level, such as in direct dialogue or collaboration; (3) the group-level, in which people share common identities and goals to attain; and (4) the cultural level, where the analysis focus on macro-elements such as history and tradition. An overarching synthesis on the social functions of emotions across all levels is proposed by Fischer and Manstead [-@fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016], who identify two complementary, but distinct, functions performed by emotions: affiliation and distancing. The affiliation function serves to form and maintain positive social relationship with others, whereas the distancing function helps in establishing and maintaining a social position relative to others (*ibid.*). Other social functions of emotion comprise the social sharing of emotion [@rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009; @rimePartageSocialEmotions2005], the use of emotional information to better understand behavior and appropriate conduct in social situations [@parkinsonEmotionsInterpersonalInteractions2010; @vankleefHowEmotionsRegulate2009; @hareliEmotionsSignalsNormative2013; @hareliWhatEmotionalReactions2010], and attempts to voluntary act upon other people's emotion by applying emotion regulation at the inter-personal level [@netzerInterpersonalInstrumentalEmotion2015; @reeckSocialRegulationEmotion2016; @zakiInterpersonalEmotionRegulation2013].

Eligio, Ainsworth and Crook [-@eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012] carried out two intertwined experiments aiming at exploring "what collaborators understand about each other's emotions and the implications of sharing information about them" (*ibid*, p. 2046). In the first experiment, the authors asked pairs of same-sex, unacquainted participants to play a collaborative game in a co-located environment, where they shared the same computer equipment. At the end of the collaboration, participants were asked to fill in two questionnaires where they had to rate the intensity of 15 emotions: *happy*, *angry*, *sad*, *fearful*, *angry*, *bored*, *challenged*, *interested*, *hopeful*, *frustrated*, *contempt*, *disgusted*, *surprised*, *proud*, *ashamed* and *guilty*. In the *own* version of the questionnaire, they rated the intensity of each emotion as they have perceived it during the task. In the *partner* version of the questionnaire, participants had to project the intensity by which their partner in the dyad had experienced each of the listed emotion. The administration of the questionnaire was made individually, so that participants could not discuss the matter with their partner, and up until that moment, participants were not informed of the rating, so that they had no particular reason to pay attention neither to their own, nor to their partners' emotions. By comparing the responses to the two questionnaires, the authors concluded that, despite collaborating side-by-side, participants had little understanding of their partner's emotions. On the contrary, consistently with previous findings in the literature [@kruegerTrulyFalseConsensus1994; @tomaAnticipatedCooperationVs2010], participants tended to project their own emotional experience onto their partners. Eligio and colleagues (*ibid*) provides two possible explanations of these results. On the one hand, participants could simply not care about the emotions of their partner. On the other hand, participants could genuinely care about them, but lack the means to focus on them, for instance because the task was too demanding, and they decided to prioritize other mental states perceived as *more* instrumental to the task at hand. In both cases, the attribution of their own emotional experiences to that of the partner is caused by a lack of information available, but the reasons for this shortcoming are not the same depending on the intentions.

In the second experiment, Eligio and colleagues (*ibid*) therefore decided to intervene by providing (or not) participants with explicit awareness of their partner's emotions using a *scripting* strategy, that is, by interrupting the collaboration at specific moments for participants to express their emotions and projecting that of their partner. After filling the *own* and *partner* questionnaire, if participants disposed of awareness, they could look at the emotions of their partner's before resuming the task, otherwise they just continued with the collaboration. Furthermore, dyads were also assigned either in a co-located or a remote collaborative setting, resulting in a 2x2 factorial design with awareness vs. no-awareness, and co-located vs. remote conditions. Using experimental settings similar to the first experiment (but with a slightly different collaborative task and with only women as participants), the authors report evidence suggesting that participants benefited of emotional awareness in terms of performance both in the co-located and remote conditions. Furthermore, participants in the remote condition were more accurate in understanding emotions of their partner and also experienced more *positive affect*, computed by averaging the intensity of *happy*, *interested*, *hopeful*, *excited* and *challenged*.

From the two experiments, Eligio and colleagues (*ibid.*) concluded that participants do not have an accurate understanding of the emotion of their partner if their attention is not explicitly driven to it. Providing emotional awareness seems thus a promising way to increase mutual understanding.

## Abstract Model of the Functions of an Emotion Awareness Tool

The information illustrated above, as well as in the previous chapter, can be integrated in an abstract model that depicts the mechanisms allegedly carried out by an EAT. The proposed abstract model does not have the pretension to establish an absolute reference; on the contrary, it aims at visually implementing the different passages that are (or may be) assumed in the instrumentality of an EAT as a support to learning activities in computer-mediated environments. The model, depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:intro-thesis-scm-model-figure), take the perspective of a learner that disposes of an EAT in its computer-mediated learning environment. The model comprises boxes for four conceptual elements: (a) the learning activity, which may refer broadly to any computer-mediated environment implementing an instructional design; (b) intra-personal emotion, representing a single event or a set of events corresponding to the learners' expressed-displayed emotions; (c) inter-personal emotion, representing a single event or set of events corresponding to emotions expressed-displayed by other learners sharing the same environment, that the learner herself can therefore perceive-monitor; and (d) an overarching *meaning-making* process, which encompasses learner's effort to extrapolate instrumental information from the emotional information available. The boxes are connected with directional arrows, numbered from 1 to 7, representing a series of processes that are (or may be) implicated in each passage. The numbers are used for identifying the passages, but do not imply a fixed order, even though some processes may be built upon previous passages. The next sections provides a discussion of each passage (*i.e.*, each numbered arrow) more specifically.

(ref:thesis-scm-caption) The EAT determines how an intra-personal emotion becomes inter-personal, and how the inter-personal emotions contribute to improve the shared understanding of the situation at hand. The situation may then trigger other intra-personal emotions.

### From the Learning Activity to Intra-Personal Emotion

Passage \#1 goes from the learning activity to an intra-personal emotion, implicating that the learning activity elicits emotions in oneself. An EAT may intervene in this passage in several ways, grouped here in a non exhaustive lists of X phenomena labeled for illustration purpose as *emotion alertness* and *emotion conceptualization*.

Emotion alertness broadly refers to the fact that the presence of the EAT represents a general reminder about paying attention to emotion during the learning activity, and therefore may increase the *sensitivity* about emotional experience. In other words, the presence of the EAT may push learners to bestow to emotional self-awareness more attention that they would normally do without the presence of the EAT [@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. Emotion alertness may be induced to different degrees, depending on, for instance, whether the EAT is always available or not, and whether explicit prompts are frequently sent to learners [@csikszentmihalyiValidityReliabilityExperienceSampling2014; @shiffmanEcologicalMomentaryAssessment2008]. As an example, Molinari and colleagues [-@molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013] implemented an EAT into a computer-mediated collaborative task that reminded participants to self-report their emotions after five minutes since the last emotion expressed.

Emotion alertness is not necessarily and automatically linked to concrete action of emotion display, that is, self-reporting the emotion into the system. In fact, even in the case of an increased alertness, learners could genuinely not feel any emotion, or decide not to express their emotion through the EAT for dispositional (*e.g.*, emotional expressivity, see @kringIndividualDifferencesDispositional1994) or contingent reasons (*e.g.*, bestow priority to the learning task at hand).

Emotion conceptualization broadly refers to the mechanisms by which learners are planned to self-report their emotions, which may vary greatly according to a number of theoretical and technical aspects. For instance, emotion self-report tools or questionnaires are very often divided in two categories, depending on whether they adopt a dimensional or a discrete perspective [@broekensAffectButtonMethodReliable2013; @fuentesSystematicLiteratureReview2017; @ritchieEvolutionSelfreportingMethods2016; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005].

In a dimensional approach, an emotion is conceptualized as a rating on a number of continuous criteria, among which the most frequently adopted ones are *valence* (also called *pleasure*) and *arousal* (also called *activation*) [*e.g.*, @russellCircumplexModelAffect1980; @stanleyTwodimensionalAffectiveSpace2009], but may also comprise different or additional dimensions. It is the case, for instance, of the Self-Assessment Manikin [@bradleyMeasuringEmotionSelfAssessment1994] or the AffectButton [@broekensAffectButtonMethodReliable2013], which both use the *valence*, *arousal*, and *dominance* dimensions, even if in different formats. The Self-Assessment Manikin [@bradleyMeasuringEmotionSelfAssessment1994] uses three rows of figures (*i.e.*, the *manikin*), where each rows represent one of the three dimensions. For each row, 5 figures, progressively modified in some features, represent the increasing or decreasing value on the specific dimension. The AffectButton [@broekensAffectButtonMethodReliable2013], on the other hand, uses a single iconic facial expression that changes according to the user's coordinates of the mouse on the surface of the icon: the horizontal movement determines the pleasure dimensions; the vertical movement the dominance dimension; and the arousal dimension is calculated according to the distance of the mouse from the central point of the image.

In a discrete approach, an emotion is conceptualized as a distinctive experience that can be identified through a verbal and/or graphical representation [@mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015]. The number, kind and organization of the representations varies depending on several aspects. In the case of verbal representations that adopts natural language nouns or adjectives, for example, the list may be determined according to emotion theories -- as in the case of basic emotion theory [@ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992] -- or determined empirically according to previous (or pilot) studies, often with the aim of retaining a list of the most frequently experienced or expressed items. For instance, Molinari and colleagues [-@molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013] implemented in a self-report interface 20 buttons, 10 labeled with negative and 10 with positive emotion adjectives retrieved among the most frequently expressed during a computer-mediated collaborative task in a pilot study. The interface also provided -- as it is considered a good practice [@mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005] -- the possibility to provide another emotion not in the list. When emotion is conceptualized graphically, representations usually attempt at maintaining some degree of analogy with *reality*, for instance with respect to facial expressions [@desmet2003measuring; @lauransNewDirectionsNonVerbal2012].

Less frequently, self-report tools attempt to combine the two approaches, as it is the case in the Geneva Emotion Wheel [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005], depicted in more details in the next chapter, or the Mood Meter application associated with the RULER approach [@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019] mentioned in the previous chapter. When the dimensional and discrete approaches coalesces, they create an underlying structure, which is often referred to as an *affective space* [*e.g.*, @davidsonParsingAffectiveSpace19940101; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @schererWhatDeterminesFeeling2006; @stanleyTwodimensionalAffectiveSpace2009]

The Mood Meter application ...

The emot-control system implemented by Feidakis and colleagues [-@feidakisProvidingEmotionAwareness2014] shows on the same interface (a) a circumplex of 14 discrete affective states, represented by stylized, and colored faces similar to smileys/emoticons, organized according to the valence x activation orthogonal axis; (b) 5 additional images of similar kind, but representing moods in a sort of 5-point Likert scale (*sad*, *unhappy*, *neutral*, *happy*, and *very happy*); (c) a free text input to type-in another emotion not listed; and (d) another free text input introduced by the field legend *Write more about your feelings*.

Depending on how emotion is conceptualized and, by extension, planned for self-report, the intra-personal awareness of emotion may be more or less guided, inducing learners to pay attention to some elements of their emotional experience that they will not necessarily consider in the same way, or with the same weight, depending on the specifics of the EAT at hand. At the same time, emotion self-report also depends on the learner herself, for instance in terms of her ability to discriminate between emotion ... ...

### From Intra-Personal Emotion to Meaning-Making

Once an emotion or a set of emotions are self-reported, it is assumed that learners may extrapolate meaning from the emotional information available. In this regard, information may be punctual, for example the last emotion or set of emotions displayed concurrently. Conversely, the system may also implement some form of data persistence, which allows to observe the accumulation and the evolution of the emotional experience over a varying time span. Depending on the way emotion information is also graphically represented, emotional meaning-making can be guided by the system, which may privilege some form of representation (*e.g.*, changes over time) over another (*e.g.*, cumulative frequency of the same emotion expressed).

Meaning-making is also tightly related to the way emotion is displayed through the system (passage \#1), not only from a technical standpoint -- since the information available is determined by what information is inserted into the system -- but also conceptually. If emotion is considered from a dimensional standpoint, learners will extrapolate meaning from the extant criteria through which dimensions are rated. On the contrary, in a discrete emotion approach, learners extrapolate meaning from an *information unity* that is supposed to provide unique meaning compared to other possible choices. Finally, if the system combines dimensional and discrete approach, learners can extrapolate meaning from both.

The system may also influence meaning-making by adding contextual information to the way emotion is displayed. For instance,

Passage \#3 starts a complementary path with respect to passages \#1 and \#2, but from an inter-personal perspective, that is, concerning emotion in others learners sharing the same computer-mediated learning environment with the learner herself. This path may in fact be optional when the EAT is exclusively concerned with emotion self-awareness [*e.g.*, @lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020], whereas it becomes an integral part when the EAT is inspired from a Group Awareness Tool perspective [*e.g.*, @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012; @feidakisProvidingEmotionAwareness2014; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013].

### From Inter-Personal Emotion to Meaning-Making

Passage \#4 consists in extrapolating meaning from the emotion of other learners sharing the same computer-mediated learning environment and whose emotions have been monitored by the learner herself.

### From Intra-Personal Emotion to Inter-Personal Emotion

Expression of emotion: emotion is made available to others depending on learners willingness to disclose their emotional experience.

Emotion influence.

Emotion sharing.

### From Inter-Personal Emotion to Intra-Personal Emotion

Emotion comparison (e.g. affiliation or differentiation). Emotion contagion.

### From Meaning-Making to the Learning Activity

Emotion is integrated into the learning activity, it modifies behavior (self-regulation, co-regulation, socially shared regulation).

Modification of learning activity can trigger another emotion, creating cycle.

## Methodological Issues

For instance, Pekrun and Linnerbrink-Garcia [@pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014, p. 2] point out that "[i]n the broader education literature, affect is often used to denote a broad variety of noncognitive constructs including emotion but also including self-concept, beliefs, motivation, and so on [...]. In contrast, in emotion research, affect refers to emotions and moods more specifically".
