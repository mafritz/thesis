  abstract = {From humble beginnings, the SUS has become a valuable tool in the toolkits of usability and user experience practitioners and researchers. We have developed regression equations that compute benchmarks for SUS items based on an overall SUS score. A review of the SUS literature on published benchmarks for the means of overall SUS scores from usability studies/surveys provides guidance on selecting an appropriate value of SUS to use when setting item benchmarks. We expect this extension of SUS benchmarking methodology to be of value to usability and user experience practitioners.},
