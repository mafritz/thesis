This chapter resumes previous work on the subject of Emotion Awareness Tools that I have conducted in my Master thesis [@fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015][^1]. The Master thesis emerged as a *spin-off* of studies conducted within the Emotion Awareness Tool for Computer-Mediated Interactions (EATMINT) project and was mainly focused on a user experience perspective, lacking therefore most of the theoretical background set forth in Part I. The Master thesis nevertheless lead to a conceptual prototype, which I named Dynamic Emotion Wheel (DEW), that was first presented at the International Society for Research on Emotion (ISRE) conference [@fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015], and later in education technology conferences [@fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2016; @fritzRealTimeEmotionalAwareness2016]. The interest elicited in both affective sciences and education technology communities corroborated the idea to implement and further extend the prototype. The chapter starts by briefly outlining the aim and scope of the EATMINT project as the context through which a series of initial requirements for an EAT were set forth. Second, it illustrates the Geneva Emotion Wheel [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005], a self-report tool based on the Component Process Model depicted in Section \@ref(cpm-section). The Geneva Emotion Wheel served as inspiration to produce the core principle of the Dynamic Emotion Wheel, illustrated in the third section of the chapter. Fourth, the chapter introduces an affective space adapted from previous work in the EATMINT project, which will also be adopted in the empirical contributions of Part III. Fifth, the results of a usability test conducted on the Dynamic Emotion Wheel in experimental settings are outlined as a preliminary assessment of the tool. Finally, the theoretical and technical extensions to pass from a prototype to a proof of concept are outlined.

## The EATMINT Project {#eatmint-project}

The Emotion Awareness Tool for Computer-Mediated Interactions (EATMINT) project was conducted as part of the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) *Affective Sciences* by a group of scholars integrating affective computing and affective sciences, computer science, education technology, education and learning sciences [@cereghettiSharingEmotionsComputermediated2015; @Chanel2013; @chanelGrandChallengeProblem2016; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @molinariFeedbackEmotionnelCollaboration2013]. When the project started in mid 2011, the topic of emotional awareness in computer-mediated collaboration was almost uncharted [@feidakisEndowingElearningSystems2011; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012]. The team therefore initiated the project to explore two intertwined objectives:

1.  Designing Emotion Awareness Tools, which allow either the explicit or the autonomic sharing of emotions in computer-mediated interaction;
2.  Studying the impact of emotional awareness on collaboration both at intra- and inter-personal levels, with respect to the emergence of strategies that improve collaboration such as monitoring, regulating and reflecting on emotions.

A first step in the project consisted in the set up of exploratory experiment, from which different type of data could be collected with respect to the following research perspectives. First, to what extent emotional awareness influences perceived emotions after collaboration and the perceived quality of interaction [@molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. This part of the study has been thoroughly illustrated in the related works of Section \@ref(ea-inter-personal) about the inter-personal function of emotional awareness. Second, to what extent the perceived interaction during a collaborative task is linked to users' emotional traits, and how an emotional awareness tool can influence this relationship [@molinariFeedbackEmotionnelCollaboration2013]. Third, to what extent physiological and eye-movement coupling predict situations that may benefit from emotional awareness information during the collaboration process [@Chanel2013].

The experimental setup was the same already described in Section \@ref(ea-in-computer-mediated-environment) about emotion in computer-mediated learning environments. In this regard, the EATMINT project members reckoned that the EAT used in pilot experiments -- already depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-eatmint-eat) and repeated hereafter in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-eatmint-eat-repeated) -- showed some limitations, and therefore planned to implement a second version of the tool to be used in future studies. I was involved in this process first as an internship in the project, and later as the subject of my Master thesis [@fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015]. This section first proposes a more thorough description of the tool. Then, it illustrates a series of requirements for the next version of the EAT, which were discussed with the EATMINT project's team. Finally, it gives a brief overview of the interaction design method which was applied to find a solution meeting these requirements.

### Description of the EATMINT's First Version of an EAT

The tool in the pilot studies of the EATMINT project was located at the right edge and occupied the whole height and about a fifth of the width of the screen. The tool was vertically divided in two areas of almost the same size.

(ref:tf-eatmint-eat-repeated-caption) The argument graphic tool and the EAT adopted in @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013, from Figure 1 in the original article (repeated from Figure \@ref(fig:tf-eatmint-eat)).

```{r tf-eatmint-eat-repeated, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:tf-eatmint-eat-repeated-caption)", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figure/theory/eatmint-eat-and-task.png"))
```

In the lower part of the tool, users could press one of the 20 buttons with a label representing an emotion adjective (e.g. *attentive*, *irritated*, *relaxed*, etc.). The list of emotions were defined mixing a previous study in the field [@dmelloDynamicsAffectiveStates2012] and 2 pre-experiments that aimed to identify the most frequent and intense emotions felt during a situation of collaboration, real or imagined. The 20 emotions were equally divided in positive and negative labelled groups, but did not follow any particular order within each list (see Table \@ref(tab:eatmint-original-emotions-table)). At the bottom-end of the screen, a "no-emotion" button spanning across the two columns was also available.

(ref:original-list-eatmint-emotions-caption) List of the 20 emotion adjectives used as buttons in the EAT. Our translation from the original French word in parentheses is based on a document by the @genevaemotionresearchgroupAppendixLabelsDescribing1988. The order in the table reflects the order of the buttons in the interface.

```{r eatmint-original-emotions-table}
eatmint_original_emotion_list <- tribble(
  ~"",   ~"Positive emotions",    ~"Negative emotions",
  1,        "Delighted (Ravi)",      "Stressed (Stréssé)",
  2,        "Attentive (Concentré)",  "Annoyed (Enervé)",
  3,        "Interested (Intéressé)", "Surprised (Surpris)",
  4,        "Satisfied (Satisfait)",  "Irritated (Irrité)",
  5,        "Empathetic (Empathique)", "Envious (Envieux)",
  6,        "Confident (Confiant)",    "Anxious (Anxieux)",
  7,        "Amused (Amusé)",          "Disappointed (Insatisfait)",
  8,        "Relaxed (Détendu)",      "Confused (Confus)",
  9,        "Grateful (Reconnaissant)", "Frustrated (Frustré)",
  10,       "Relieved (Soulagé)",     "Bored (Lassé)"
)

eatmint_original_emotion_list |> 
  kable(
    caption = "(ref:original-list-eatmint-emotions-caption)\\label{tab:eatmint-original-emotions-table}",
    caption.short = "Original list of EATMINT emotions",
    longtable = FALSE,
    booktabs = TRUE
  )

```

In the upper side of the tool, participants could see the last three emotions they had expressed and the last three emotions manifested by the partner. Their own emotions appeared in the upper side as a vertical list of text-centered cases with a green background. The very last emotion had a lighter background and resulted on top of the list. This case also served as a text input where participants could type an emotion not in the list. Their partner's emotions appeared just below, in exactly the same way, except for a blue background and the first light-blue case not editable.

Each participant could express the emotion felt in one of three ways: (1) clicking one of the 20 emotion labelled buttons; (2) typing an emotion not in the list directly in the first light-green case; or (3) by clicking the "no-emotion" button at the bottom-end of the screen. The expressed emotion would then appear in the upper light-green case of his screen, and, respectively, in the upper light-blue case of the partner's screen.

### Requirements for a Second Version of an EAT

Following the analysis of the experiment from the team and the feedback provided by participants -- who found, for instance, the custom disposition of the discrete emotions labels not helping -- a requirement analysis was conducted with the members of the EATMINT project. At first, the requirements were set forth from a general, brainstorming perspective and it was the aim of the internship to try to put them together in a coherent interface. The requirements analysis conducted to the identification of five main characteristics of the tool.

First, it should keep the voluntary self-report approach. Even though the project's aim contemplated both autonomic and voluntary tools, this one was intended to follow-up on the voluntary disclosure of the emotional experience.

Second, the tool should be inspired by an emotion theory. One potential theory that was discussed in this regard was Pekrun's Control-Value theory of achievement emotions [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2014] already cited in Sections \@ref(learning-on-affect) and \@ref(appraisal-theories). Given that the theory is deeply rooted in the appraisal family, it was also suggested that the tool should integrate a dimensional approach representing the Control and Value appraisals rather than relying exclusively on discrete emotions.

Third, an additional reason to switch to a dimensional approach concerned the reduction of the number of discrete emotions on screen, which was perceived as a source of cognitive overload from participants. The sheer number of discrete labels available, combined with the lack of a specific order, forced participants to perform a seek-and-evaluate task [@rouetRechercheInformationsDans1995] every time they had to click on a proposed label.

Fourth, the presence of 20 buttons on the interface also reduced the space available for the perceiving-monitoring function of an awareness tool. Only the last three emotions for each participant appeared on the interface without any further information such as the time when they occurred or in which order they appeared considering the dyad as a whole. In other words, it was possible to establish in which order each participant had expressed their last emotions, but not if the very last emotion of the dyad belonged to the first or second participant. It was also impossible to tell, from the interface alone, if the order of the emotion followed a one-each turn, or a participant expressed three emotions in a row. Consequently, for the new version of the tool, the EATMINT project members wanted to enhance the possibility for participants to (1) dispose of the evolution of their own emotional state during time, and (2) compare this evolution with their partner's one.

A last requirement, of more general scope, concerned the flexibility of the tool with respect both to theoretical and technical features. On the theoretical level, the new version of the tool should provide experiments with as much leverage as possible about the underlying theoretical framework, for example the number and labels of the emotions. On the technical level, the interface of the tool could also be considered as a potential factor in the experimental settings. For example, a group of participants could dispose of an interface that particularly highlights inter-personal comparison, whereas the other group an interface that provides more insight on the intra-personal evolution over time. Finally, the tool should also provide a way to set up emotional awareness in experimental settings without specific technical knowledge, and dispose in the meantime of collected data in a practical form for exportation and subsequent statistical treatment.

### Interaction Design Process

The establishment of requirements was the first step in the interaction design method [@cooperFaceEssentialInteraction2007; @rogersInterctionDesignHumanComputer2011], which is driven by the underlying assumption to take the end-user perspective from the very onset of the process. The other steps advocated by this iterative method are: the design of alternatives, often based on an analysis of existing and concurrent products; building prototypes at various levels of fidelity; and finally evaluating to what extent the prototype meets users' functional needs and perceptual preferences. The full process that eventually lead to the Dynamic Emotion Wheel is thoroughly depicted in my Master thesis [@fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015]. Hereafter only the most important steps in the process are illustrated, starting from the identification of the closest existing product that presented some of the features aimed by the new version of the EAT.

## The Geneva Emotion Wheel {#gew}

The Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW) is an emotion self-report tool based upon the Component Process Model (CPM) theoretical framework illustrated in Section \@ref(cpm-section), which, at the time of writing, is in its third version [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014]. This section starts with a description of the tool and how it relates to the CPM. It then illustrates some uses that have been made of the tool, which relates to the concept of emotional awareness. Finally, it assesses the limitations of the tool with respect to the features retained as a central tenets for the implementation of an EAT in the current contribution.

### Description of the Geneva Emotion Wheel

> The design characteristics for the instrument to be developed are as follows:
>
> -   concentrating on the feeling component of emotion, in the sense of qualia, rather than asking respondents to judge concrete response characteristics such as sympathetic arousal;
> -   going beyond a simple valence-arousal space in order to be better able to differentiate qualitatively different states that share the same region in this space;
> -   relying on standard emotion labels in natural languages in order to capitalize on respondents' intuitive understanding of the semantic field;
> -   allowing systematic assessment of the intensity of the feeling;
> -   going beyond the arbitrariness of choosing different sets of emotion terms and presenting them in very unsystematic fashion by building some emotion structure into the instrument;
> -   presenting the instrument in a graphical form that is userfriendly, allowing the respondent to rapidly understand the principle and use the instrument in a reliable fashion. --- @schererWhatAreEmotions2005, p. 721

Driven by these tenets, Scherer [-@schererWhatAreEmotions2005] developed and refined over the years [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013] one of the most widely adopted emotion self-report tool: the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW). For instance, the GEW is also presented in an overarching chapter [@shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014] about emotion in the *International Handbook of Emotions in Education* [@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014], which is, to the best of my knowledge, the most up-to-date and comprehensive resource about emotion in education. The GEW is an instrumental implementation of the Component Process Model theoretical framework illustrated above. It combines the two most widely adopted approaches to emotion self-report -- the dimensional and discrete emotions approaches [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005] -- by establishing a causal link between the appraisal [@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001] and the subjective feeling [@grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008] components -- that is, between the cognitive evaluation of the situation and the holistic experience that usually emerges to consciousness as a natural language word or idiom. This direct link is also corroborated by recent empirical contributions investigating whether the emotional meaning of words often adopted, in different cultures, to express emotional experiences can be traced back to specific evaluations of the eliciting event [@fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @fontaineWhyWhatHow2013; @gentschEffectsAchievementContexts2017; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018].

(ref:gew-version-3-caption) The third version of the Geneva Emotion Wheel [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013]

```{r gew-version-3-figure, fig.cap="(ref:gew-version-3-caption)", fig.align="center", out.width="100%" }
include_graphics(here("figure/dew/gew-v3.png"))
```

The interface of the GEW, depicted in its third version in Figure \@ref(fig:gew-version-3-figure) [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013], presents 20 subjective feelings -- chosen with respect to their frequency in emotion literature and everyday language use -- organized in a circumplex, which is determined by two appraisal dimensions as axes: *Valence* on the abscissa and *Control/Power* on the ordinate. Each feeling is positioned according to a value along both axes and belongs thus to one of the four quadrants of the circumplex, determined by the combination of positive or negative Valence, and positive or negative Control/Power. From the origin of the axes stem 5 circles for each of the subjective feelings. The circles grow in size as they get closer to the edge of the circumplex, so that the first circle is the smallest, and the last one the biggest. Users can therefore choose, first, the *row* of circles that corresponds to the subjective feeling they are experiencing and, second, the intensity of the feeling as a function of the circle's size.
