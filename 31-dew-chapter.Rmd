This chapter resumes previous work on the subject of Emotion Awareness Tools that I have conducted in my Master thesis [@fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015][^1]. The Master thesis was a *spin-off* of the Emotion Awareness Tool for Computer-Mediated Interactions (EATMINT) project and was first mainly focused on a user experience perspective, lacking therefore most of the theoretical background set forth in Part I. The Master thesis nevertheless lead to a conceptual prototype, which I named Dynamic Emotion Wheel (DEW), that was first presented at the International Society for Research on Emotion (ISRE) conference [@fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015], and later in education technology conferences [@fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2016; @fritzRealTimeEmotionalAwareness2016]. The interest elicited in both affective sciences and education technology communities corroborated further conceptual and technical work on the prototype. The chapter starts by briefly outlining the aim and scope of the EATMINT project as the context through which a series of initial requirements for an EAT were set forth. Second, it illustrates the Geneva Emotion Wheel [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005], a self-report tool based on the Component Process Model depicted in Section \@ref(cpm-section). The Geneva Emotion Wheel served as inspiration to produce the core principle of the Dynamic Emotion Wheel, illustrated in the third section of the chapter. Fourth, the chapter introduces an affective space adapted from previous work in the EATMINT project, which will also be adopted in the empirical contributions of Part III. Fifth, the results of a usability test conducted on the Dynamic Emotion Wheel in experimental settings are outlined as a preliminary assessment of the tool. Finally, the theoretical and technical extensions to pass from a prototype to a proof of concept are outlined.

## The EATMINT Project {#eatmint-project}

The Emotion Awareness Tool for Computer-Mediated Interactions (EATMINT) project was conducted as part of the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) *Affective Sciences* by a group of scholars integrating affective computing and affective sciences, computer science, education technology, education and learning sciences [@cereghettiSharingEmotionsComputermediated2015; @Chanel2013; @chanelGrandChallengeProblem2016; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @molinariFeedbackEmotionnelCollaboration2013]. When the project started in mid 2011, the topic of emotional awareness in computer-mediated collaboration was almost uncharted [@feidakisEndowingElearningSystems2011; @eligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012]. The team therefore initiated the project to explore two intertwined objectives:

1.  Designing Emotion Awareness Tools, which allow either the explicit or the autonomic sharing of emotions in computer-mediated interaction;
2.  Studying the impact of emotional awareness on collaboration both at intra- and inter-personal levels, with respect to the emergence of strategies that improve collaboration such as monitoring, regulating and reflecting on emotions.

A first step in the project consisted in the set up of exploratory experiment, from which different types of data could be collected according to complementary research perspectives. First, to what extent emotional awareness influences perceived emotions after collaboration and the perceived quality of interaction [@molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. This part of the study has been thoroughly illustrated in the related works of Section \@ref(ea-inter-personal) about the inter-personal function of emotional awareness. Second, to what extent the perceived interaction during a collaborative task is linked to users' emotional traits, and how an emotional awareness tool can influence this relationship [@molinariFeedbackEmotionnelCollaboration2013]. Third, to what extent physiological and eye-movement coupling predict situations that may benefit from emotional awareness information during the collaborative process [@Chanel2013].

The experimental setup was the same already described in Section \@ref(ea-in-computer-mediated-environment) about emotion in computer-mediated learning environments. In this regard, the EATMINT project members reckoned that the EAT used in pilot experiments -- already depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-eatmint-eat) and repeated hereafter in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-eatmint-eat-repeated) -- showed some limitations, and therefore planned to implement a second version of the tool to be used in future studies. I was involved in this process first as an internship in the project, and later as the subject of my Master thesis [@fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015]. This section starts with a more comprhensive description of the tool. Then, it illustrates a series of requirements for the next version of the EAT, which were discussed with the EATMINT project's team. Finally, it gives a brief overview of the interaction design method which was applied to find a solution meeting these requirements.

### Description of the EATMINT's First Version of an EAT

The tool in the pilot studies of the EATMINT project was persistenly located at the right edge of the screen, occupying the whole height and about a fifth of the width. The tool was vertically divided in two areas of almost the same size.

(ref:tf-eatmint-eat-repeated-caption) The argument graphic tool and the EAT adopted in @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013, from Figure 1 in the original article (repeated from Figure \@ref(fig:tf-eatmint-eat)).

```{r tf-eatmint-eat-repeated, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:tf-eatmint-eat-repeated-caption)", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figure/theory/eatmint-eat-and-task.png"))
```

The lower part of the tool was dedicated to the expressing-displaying function of an awareness tool. Users could encode their emotional experience by pressing one of 20 buttons, each labelled with a lexicalized emotion in the form of an adjective (e.g. *attentive*, *irritated*, *relaxed*, etc.). The list of discrete emotions was defined by combining a previous study about affective dynamics during complex learning [@dmelloDynamicsAffectiveStates2012] and two pilot studies that aimed at identifying the most frequent and intense emotions felt during a situation of collaboration, real or imagined. The 20 discrete emotions were equally divided in *positive* and *negative* labelled groups, available side by side, but did not follow any particular order within each list (see Table \@ref(tab:eatmint-original-emotions-table)). At the bottom-end of the screen, a "no-emotion" button spanning across the two columns was also available.

(ref:original-list-eatmint-emotions-caption) List of the 20 emotion adjectives used as buttons in the EAT. Our translation from the original French word in parentheses is based on a document by the @genevaemotionresearchgroupAppendixLabelsDescribing1988. The order in the table reflects the order of the buttons in the interface.

```{r eatmint-original-emotions-table}
eatmint_original_emotion_list <- tribble(
  ~"",   ~"Positive emotions",    ~"Negative emotions",
  1,        "Delighted (Ravi)",      "Stressed (Stréssé)",
  2,        "Attentive (Concentré)",  "Annoyed (Enervé)",
  3,        "Interested (Intéressé)", "Surprised (Surpris)",
  4,        "Satisfied (Satisfait)",  "Irritated (Irrité)",
  5,        "Empathetic (Empathique)", "Envious (Envieux)",
  6,        "Confident (Confiant)",    "Anxious (Anxieux)",
  7,        "Amused (Amusé)",          "Disappointed (Insatisfait)",
  8,        "Relaxed (Détendu)",      "Confused (Confus)",
  9,        "Grateful (Reconnaissant)", "Frustrated (Frustré)",
  10,       "Relieved (Soulagé)",     "Bored (Lassé)"
)

eatmint_original_emotion_list |> 
  kable(
    caption = "(ref:original-list-eatmint-emotions-caption)\\label{tab:eatmint-original-emotions-table}",
    caption.short = "Original list of EATMINT emotions",
    longtable = FALSE,
    booktabs = TRUE
  )

```

The upper side of the tool was primarily concerned with the perceiving-monitoring function of an awareness tool. Participants could in fact see the last three emotions they had expressed and the last three emotions manifested by the partner. Their own emotions appeared in the upper side as a vertical list of text-centered cases with a green background. The very last emotion had a lighter background and resulted on top of the list. This case also served as a text input where participants could type an emotion not in the list, having thus also an expressing-displaying function. Their partner's emotions appeared just below, in exactly the same way, except for a blue background and the first light-blue case that was not editable.

As a result, each participant could voluntarily express their emotional experience in one of three ways: (1) by clicking one of the 20 emotion labelled buttons; (2) by typing an emotion not in the list directly in the first light-green case; or (3) by clicking the "no-emotion" button at the bottom-end of the screen. The expressed emotion would then appear in the upper light-green case of the participant's own screen, and, respectively, in the upper light-blue case of the partner's screen.

### Requirements for a Second Version of an EAT

Following the analysis of the experiment from the team and the feedback provided by participants -- who found, for instance, the custom disposition of the discrete emotions labels not helping -- a requirement analysis was conducted with the members of the EATMINT project. At first, the requirements were set forth from a general, brainstorming perspective and it was the aim of the internship to try to put them together in a coherent interface. The requirements analysis identified five main characteristics of the tool.

First, it should keep the voluntary self-report approach. Even though the project's aim contemplated both autonomic and voluntary tools, this specific EAT was intended to follow-up on the voluntary disclosure of the emotional experience.

Second, the tool should be inspired by an emotion theory. One potential theory that was considered in this regard was Pekrun's Control-Value theory of achievement emotions [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2014], already cited in Sections \@ref(learning-on-affect) and \@ref(appraisal-theories). Given that the theory is deeply rooted in the appraisal family, it was also suggested that the tool should integrate a dimensional approach representing the Control and Value appraisals rather than relying exclusively on discrete emotions.

Third, an additional reason to switch to a dimensional approach concerned the reduction of the number of discrete emotions on screen, which was perceived as a source of cognitive overload from participants. The sheer number of discrete labels available, combined with the lack of a specific order, forced participants to perform a seek-and-evaluate task [@rouetRechercheInformationsDans1995] every time they had to click on a proposed label.

Fourth, the presence of 20 buttons on the interface also reduced the space available for the perceiving-monitoring function of an awareness tool. Only the last three emotions for each participant appeared on the interface without any further information such as the time when they occurred or in which order they appeared considering the dyad as a whole. In other words, it was possible to establish in which order each participant had expressed their last emotions, but not if the very last emotion of the dyad belonged to the first or second participant. It was also impossible to tell, from the interface alone, if the order of the emotion followed a one-each turn, or a participant expressed three emotions in a row. Consequently, for the new version of the tool, the EATMINT project members wanted to enhance the possibility for participants to (1) dispose of the evolution of their own emotional state during time, and (2) compare this evolution with their partner's one.

A last requirement, of a more general scope, concerned the flexibility of the tool with respect both to theoretical and technical features. On the theoretical level, the new version of the tool should provide experiments with as much leverage as possible about the underlying theoretical framework, for example the number and labels of the emotions. On the technical level, the interface of the tool could also be considered as a potential factor in the experimental settings. For example, a group of participants could dispose of an interface that particularly highlights inter-personal comparison, whereas the other group an interface that provides more insight on the intra-personal evolution over time. Finally, the tool should also provide a way to set up emotional awareness in experimental settings without specific technical knowledge, and dispose in the meantime of collected data in a practical form for exportation and subsequent analysis.

### Interaction Design Process

The establishment of requirements was the first step in the interaction design method [@cooperFaceEssentialInteraction2007; @rogersInterctionDesignHumanComputer2011], which is driven by the underlying assumption to take the end-user perspective from the very onset of the process. The other steps advocated by this iterative method are: the design of alternatives, often based on an analysis of existing and concurrent products; building prototypes at various levels of fidelity; and finally evaluating to what extent the prototype meets users' functional needs and perceptual preferences. The full process that eventually lead to the Dynamic Emotion Wheel is thoroughly depicted in my Master thesis [@fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015]. Hereafter, only the most important steps in the process are illustrated, starting from the identification of the closest existing product that presented some of the features aimed by the new version of the EAT.

## The Geneva Emotion Wheel {#gew}

The Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW) is an emotion self-report tool based upon the Component Process Model (CPM) theoretical framework illustrated in Section \@ref(cpm-section). At the time of writing, the tool is in its third version, having received modifications over the years [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014]. This section starts with a description of the tool and how it relates to the CPM. It then illustrates an empirical use of the tool, which resonates with emotional awareness. Finally, it assesses the limitations of the tool with respect to the features retained as a central tenet for the implementation of an EAT in the current contribution.

### Description of the Geneva Emotion Wheel

The GEW was initially created under the assumption that "it might be worth investing in the development of an instrument capable of combining the advantages of the precise differentiation provided by natural language labels with the simple organizational structure afforded by a two-dimensional space" [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013, p. 283], see also Section \@ref(ea-in-computer-mediated-environment). The assumption also posits that being emotion determined by the cognitive evaluation of the situation described in Section \@ref(cpm-appraisal-module), the two-dimensional space of the GEW should be determined by appraisal dimensions. In the meantime, the discrete emotions -- represented by lexicalized emotions as manifestations of the subjective feeling illustrated in Section \@ref(subjective-feeling) -- should be arranged according to the affective space that emerges from the combination of the two underlying dimensions [@schererWhatDeterminesFeeling2006; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013]. The GEW, depicted in its third version in Figure \@ref(fig:gew-version-3-figure) [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013], thus, places 20 lexicalized emotions in the form of natural language words around a circumplex determined by the Valence dimension on the horizontal axis, and the Control/Power dimension on the vertical axis.

The choice of the two dimensions is warranted by the fact that there is a clear correspondence between the two dimensions and the sequential evaluation checks of the CPM (see Table \@ref(tab:tf-cpm-secs). The widely adopted dimension of Valence corresponds to the stimulus evaluation checks pertaining to the *Implications/Consequences* group, namely intrinsic pleasantness and goal conduciveness. The same applies to the stimulus evaluation check of the *Coping potential* group, which can be related to the dimension of Control/Power, often adopted in dimensional approaches [@osgoodNatureMeasurementMeaning1952; @broekensAffectButtonMethodReliable2013; @bradleyMeasuringEmotionSelfAssessment1994]. Previous studies on appraisals criteria have also confirmed that the two appraisal groups are also the ones that contribute the most to emotion differentiation [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013], even if they are not enough, as previously mentioned, to account for all the variation [@gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @fontaineWorldEmotionsNot2007]. It is also worth noting that the authors discarded the most commonly adopted dimension of Arousal/Activation [@russellCircumplexModelAffect1980; @feidakisEndowingElearningSystems2011; @feidakisReviewEmotionAwareSystems2016; @brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019] for it makes difficult to distinguish between the intensity of the subjective feeling from the intensity of the bodily excitation [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013]. Furthermore, the authors also point out that:

> while most lay persons have little problem evaluating the positivity or negativity of a feeling (or event) and the approximate degree of their felt arousal, the resulting point in two-dimensional space has no specific meaning for them and cannot be communicated to others. It would seem very strange to tell someone that I feel 2.3 positive and 1.6 aroused.\
> --- @schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013, p. 283

The 20 lexicalized emotions are thus positioned according to a value along the Valence and the Control/Power dimensions. As a consequence, each discrete emotion belongs to one of the four quadrants of the circumplex, determined by the combination of positive or negative Valence, and positive or negative Control/Power. The discrete emotions labels of version 3.0 are in clockwise order: *interest*, *amusement*, *pride*, *joy* and *pleasure* for the positive Valence and high/positive Control/Power quadrant; *contentment*, *admiration*, *love*, *relief* and *compassion* for the positive Valence and low/negative Control/Power quadrant; *sadness*, *guilt*, *regret*, *shame* and *disappointment* for the negative Valence and low/negative Control/Power quadrant; and *fear*, *disgust*, *contempt*, *hate*, and *anger* for the negative Valence and high/positive Control/Power quadrant.

Furthermore, from the origin of the axes stem 5 circles for each of the lexicalized emotions. The circles grow in size as they get closer to the edge of the circumplex, so that the first circle is the smallest, and the last one the biggest. Participants can therefore choose, first, the *row* of circles that corresponds to the subjective feeling they are experiencing and, second, the intensity of the emotion as a function of the circle's size. At the same time, respondents are also provided with the "None" and "Other" options available in the center of the circumplex, which is considered a good practice in emotion self-report [@mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015].

(ref:gew-version-3-caption) The third version of the Geneva Emotion Wheel [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013]

```{r gew-version-3-figure, fig.cap="(ref:gew-version-3-caption)", fig.align="center", out.width="100%" }
include_graphics(here("figure/dew/gew-v3.png"))
```

It is worth noting that, whereas the two dimensions have been constant over the evolution of the tool, the number and labels of the lexicalized emotions have been modified with each of the three versions of the tool, even though the aim has been consistently to provide users with intuitive, widely adopted natural language words representative of major emotion families (i.e. modal emotions). In fact, the positioning of the discrete emotions proved to be particularly difficult. If the position of the lexicalized emotions for version 1.0 and 2.0 was empirically validated for most of them on the Valence dimension, the same was not true for the Control/Power dimension [@sacharinGenevaEmotionWheel2012]. This aspect will be further developed in Section \@ref(gew-limitations). For this descriptive passage, it is worth mentioning that the disposition of the 20 lexicalized emotion of the third version of the GEW has been determined using the GRID instrument mentioned in Section \@ref(subjective-feeling). The authors who have been working on the third version of the GEW also suggest that a custom choice of lexicalized emotions is possible, but should ideally be determined by the GRID instrument. In this regard, the MiniGRID or the CoreGRID [@schererCoreGRIDMiniGRIDDevelopment2013], which are shorter version of the GRID, can be adopted to limit the number of ratings needed to determine the position of each lexicalized emotion.

To sum up, the design of the GEW provides different interesting features from the point of view of an EAT. First, it implements an emotion structure in a self-report tool by combining appraisal dimensions and subjective feelings into a theoretically and empirically driven underlying structure. Second, the subjective feeling is represented by lexicalized emotions that are meant to be widely accessible in the emotional vocabulary due to their frequency in everyday language. Third, it allows the assessment not only of the kind of emotional experience, but also its intensity through the size of the circles. Fourth, the whole is *packed* into a user-friendly interface that can be immediately understood by respondents and produce reliable emotion self-report [@caicedoHowYouFeel2006].

### The Geneva Emotion Wheel as Emotional Awareness Tool

The GEW has been adopted in a wide variety of empirical contributions ranging from consumer attitudes towards a product to the use of the tool from an experience sample method perspective [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013]. Even though the primary aim of the GEW is the accuracy in individual self-report of the subjective emotional experience, there has also been attempts to use it at the inter-personal level.

In particular, @tranEmotionsDecisionMakingProcesses2012 adopted the GEW -- in what seems version 1.0, which is probably why the version is unspecified in the article -- to investigate the role of emotions in decision-making at the collective level in management teams. Participants formed groups of 4 to 7 participantsin to simulate the collective conduction of a company during fictitious long-term periods of 8 years, represented by *stints* of three hours in the study. Participants expressed on the GEW, using a pencil and paper version of the tool, two emotions at the beginning, at the mid-point, and at the end of each period. The six emotions appeared on the same sheet with the underlying structure of the GEW, and each emotion was identified by a code: B1 and B2 for the two emotions at the beginning of the period, M1 and M2 for mid-point, and E1 and E2 for the end-point. The individual rating of the emotional experience was then shared with the other members of the team. This fact created the conditions for emotional awareness to emerge in the teams. Among the practical implications of the study, in fact, the authors highlight what follows.

> Over the course of this study, it could be observed that participants often used the Emotion Wheel as a medium to discuss their emotions freely with their colleagues and it became part of the norms of the teams to do so. Thus, discussing emotions yields self-awareness and awareness at the group level when, for example, participants discuss their group consensus emotion. In addition, by mapping emotions on the Emotion Wheel on a regular basis, everyone can see the evolution of the emotional climate and team members can proactively manage it.\
> --- @tranEmotionsDecisionMakingProcesses2012, p. 22

Having their emotions expressed on the underlying structure represented by appraisal dimensions, in fact, allowed participants to notice not only the switch from a discrete emotion to another, but also the switch from a position in the circumplex to another, for instance a change from a quadrant to another. To sum up, the implementation of a theoretically driven emotion structure facilitated the emergence of emotional awareness, with the consistency and familiarity of the structure becoming a pivotal element in the consideration of emotions within the task at hand. This empirically corroborates the potential usefulness in implementing an emotion structure into an EAT.

### Limitations and Missing Features in the Geneva Emotion Wheel {#gew-limitations}

Notwithstanding the many features of the GEW that corroborate the intrinsic quality as a self-report instrument, as well as the possibility to adopt it in circumstances linked to emotional awareness, the tool presents a number of limitations and missing features, particularly from the point of view of an EAT with the characteristics sought after in the present contribution. Most of them are from a technical or user-experience perspective. Others, though, are grounded more at a conceptual level that interacts also with the theoretical underpinning of the tool. These are headed first, leaving more practical considerations as a follow-up.

As mentioned in the description of the GEW, the two underlying dimensions from which the emotional structure is denoted, are Valence and Control/Power. In an attempt to empirically validate the disposition of the first two versions of the GEW both with and without the GRID, the Control/Power dimension was particularly hard to match [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @sacharinGenevaEmotionWheel2012; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018]. The problem was particularly exacerbated when the disposition of the lexicalized emotion was determined through direct rating on the two dimensions. In that case, the Valence dimension was depicted as "the situation is experienced as (un)pleasant and enjoyable (disagreeable) and/or is likely to have positive and desired (negative and undesired) consequences for the person". Control/Power was in turn stated as "the person believes that he/she can (cannot) influence the situation to maintain or improve it (if desired)" [@sacharinGenevaEmotionWheel2012]. Results highlighted a substantial overlapping, or correlation, between the Valence and the Control/Power dimensions, especially with the top-right (negative Valence and high/positive Control/Power) and bottom-left (positive Valence and low/negative Control/Power) quadrants. As a consequence, the perception of the two dimensions is not orthogonal as the underlying structure may imply. Another problem was also encountered with the GRID instrument, though, for the features related to the Control/Power dimension did not yield the theoretical importance associated with the Coping potential in emotion elicitation and differentiation [@schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018].

Two main reasons are posited for these difficulties [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @sacharinGenevaEmotionWheel2012; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018]. First, the notion of control may be too abstract for non-psychologists. As a result, even the sheer way by which the dimension is instantiated through wording may be misleading. It may thus be a matter of trial and error before a viable description is found in order to align the theoretical and the perceived character of the dimension. To this extent, the CoreGRID already modified some wording in the rating of related features [@schererCoreGRIDMiniGRIDDevelopment2013]. Second, the Control/Power dimension may be intrinsically *valenced* [@shumanLevelsValence2013]. Situations with low control are perceived as generally unpleasant, whereas situations with high control are perceived as pleasant. As summarized by Scherer and Fontaine:

> It is exceedingly difficult to construct items that allow one to obtain valid assessments of control/power/coping appraisals, partly because of the strong relationship to valence (it is good to have high power).\
> --- @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018, p. 9

Another limitation linked to the underlying appraisal dimensions is that, in the GEW, these dimensions are not manifest. The problem with the Control/Power dimension surfaces only from a retro-engineering mechanism, but on the tool itself, there is no explicit mention of neither Valence nor Control/Power. The two appraisal dimensions are used to organize the lexicalized emotion, but there is no explicit guarantee that a person choosing *shame* (bottom-left quadrant) is *aware* of having evaluated the situation as unpleasant and with little coping potential -- that is, unless the respondent is informed beforehand of the semantic value of the interface. Without this kind of training, even the emotional awareness role played by the GEW in @tranEmotionsDecisionMakingProcesses2012 may be repositioned. According to more thorough information about the procedure available in @tranInfluenceEmotionsDecisionmaking2004, participants received definitions of the emotions on the GEW taken from a dictionary. As a consequence, there was probably some information about Valence-like features, but less likely about an underlying theoretical construct such as Control/Power. When tracing the evolution of the emotional experience between the quadrants, participants may have not been completely aware of the *dimensional* leaps undertaken, if not by the inference that adjacent emotions on the interface were more akin than those afar.

From a more practical standpoint, the GEW is also doomed to occupy a considerable share of a screen, as it is the case for the *emot-control* [@feidakisProvidingEmotionAwareness2014; @feidakis2013] illustrated in the related works of Section \@ref(ea-in-computer-mediated-environment). The strength of this kind of interfaces is to provide an organized structure to the discrete emotions, disposing at the same time of all the available options. As a consequence, this design is not very responsive to scale in proportion to the number of options available. A greater number of discrete emotions would shrink the interface to the point of overlapping boundaries, especially of the circles to rate the intensity. A lower number of options, without rescaleing the overall size of the interface, would tear options far apart, injecting negative space in between, which would be of limited visuo-spatial use [@hegartyCognitiveScienceVisualspatial2011].
