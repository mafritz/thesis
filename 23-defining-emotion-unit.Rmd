This chapter lays out the foundation for implementing the emotion structure into an EAT. The structure of an emotion is determined by its definition. For this reason, the chapter starts by highlighting the difficulties in reaching a consensual definition of what an emotion is. Next, a brief outline of competing emotion theories is provided. Among these theories, the contribution adopts appraisal theories of emotion, whose characterizing features are depicted in the third section of the chapter. Among appraisal theories, the Component Process Model, depicted in section 4, is retained as the theory of reference for the implementation of the EAT. The framework presents also the advantages of proposing a concrete link with emotional competence, which is discussed in the last section of the chapter.

## What is an Emotion?

*What is an emotion?* is a question that literally appears in a multitude of scientific contributions. For instance, it is the title of a seminal article by William James [-@jamesWhatEmotion1884], which, despite being more than a century old, is still source of lively debate [@ellsworthWilliamJamesEmotion1994; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. There are many iconic statements that testify to the difficulty of studying emotions from a scientific perspective. Fehr and Russel [-@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984, p. 464] argued that "[e]veryone knows what an emotion is, until asked to give a definition", which resonates with Kleinginna and Kleinginna [-@kleinginnaCategorizedListEmotion1981], who, around the same time forty years ago, collected almost one hundred definitions. More recently, Frijda and Scherer [-@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009, p. 142] still confirmed that "emotion may be one of the fuzziest concepts in all of the sciences", which was empirically corroborated by Izard [-@izardManyMeaningsAspects2010], who attempted -- and failed -- to extrapolate a unitary definition from the responses of 35 leading researchers from different fields to 6 questions about emotion definition, function, activation and regulation.

In the last few decades, though, a growing consensus has emerged over a *minimal*, consensual definition of some characteristics of emotion that are shared by different scholars and models of emotion [@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009; @kleinginnaCategorizedListEmotion1981; @moorsTheoriesEmotionCausation2009; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013]. Sander (2013, p. 16) resumes this consensus in four points: (1) emotions are multicomponent phenomena, spanning affective, cognitive, behavioral and physiological processes ; (2) emotions are a two-step process involving *emotion elicitation* mechanisms that produce *emotional responses*; (3) emotions have relevant object focus, being triggered by internal or external events/stimuli that are relevant for the organism; and (4) emotions have a brief duration compared with other affective phenomena such as moods, attitudes or preferences.

Within this consensual framework, though, different positions persist, which have both theoretical and applied consequences in the study of emotion *per se*, as well as in conjunction with other phenomena. These differences are often rooted in historical, cultural and epistemological contexts, within and across disciplines and approaches -- see @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003 and @plamperHistoryEmotionsIntroduction2015 for overarching perspectives, or @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013 for a more concise introduction. Some of the broader controversies regarding emotion can be encapsulated in onion layers that are highly interconnected and mutually influenced. From the outset to the inset, controversies may concern:

-   How emotion relates to, and differ from other phenomenon of the mind/body such as intelligence, rationality, consciousness or various forms of cognition [@broschImpactEmotionPerception2013; @leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987; @liebermanBooConsciousnessProblem2019; @rollsEmotionDecisionmakingExplained2014; @becharaRoleEmotionDecisionmaking2004; @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013; @murphyIntelligenceInterpersonalSensitivity2011; @saloveyEmotionalIntelligence1990];
-   How emotion relates to, and differ from other affective phenomena such as moods, preferences, attitudes, motivation, desires, feelings, sentiments, or passions [@linnenbrink-garciaAdaptiveMotivationEmotion2016; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003; @schwarz2003mood; @colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014];
-   Whether there are, and what are the building blocks and features covering the whole process, from causation to consequences, shared by all phenomena identified as emotion [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @moorsTheoriesEmotionCausation2009; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985];
-   Whether there are a countable number of, and how to distinguish between discrete emotions -- such as *anger*, *fear*, or *happiness* -- and if is it possible to categorize them in taxonomies [@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984; @fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @scarantinoDonGiveBasic2011; @ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992]
-   How a specific emotion, assuming that a discrete emotion exists, should be referred to -- both from an everyday communication and scientific conceptualization points of view -- considering differences between cultures and languages [@ekmanWhatMeantCalling2011; @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @torrePuttingFeelingsWords2018; @grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008; @schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013; @douglas-cowieEmotionalSpeechNew2003].

The implementation of an EAT, especially one that has a multipurpose vocation, must therefore face the complexity of defining the *unit* that it aims to make people aware of [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007]. In this regard, a first, broad decision that shall be considered can be related to what Scarantino and de Sousa [-@sep-emotion] identify as the two *desiderata* of emotion definition. The first consists in shaping the definition of emotion in order to achieve compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage, which corresponds to a descriptive definition. The second aims at finding a definition of emotion that is theoretically fruitful, that is, a prescriptive definition. The two desiderata are not mutually exclusive, since even a prescriptive definition should try to maintain as much compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage as possible [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. But, in the case of incompatibility with ordinary intuition, a prescriptive definition should favor theoretical generalization [@scarantinoHowDefineEmotions2012]. Roughly translated in more concrete terms, a definition of emotion should guide the implementation of an EAT in deciding whether it shall convey what users consider an emotion to be from a *folk* perspective, or rather what an emotion should be considered according to a *scientific* perspective [@scarantinoHowDefineEmotions2012; @fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @ogarkovaFolkEmotionConcepts2013].

From a pure usability standpoint, that is, the perspective of a learner that must face a tool she is not used to have in a learning environment, a *folk* perspective should not be discarded as simplistic. For instance, an EAT could be based on the most frequent affective states encountered by learners [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018], without any relationship with a prescriptive definition, and regardless of whether these states are more or less prototypical of emotion [@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984; @scarantinoDonGiveBasic2011]. Even more bluntly, an EAT could avoid the problem altogether by prompting users to share *what they think an emotion is*, letting them construe the meaning of how they feel without any guidance [@barrettKnowingWhatYou2001; @barrettSolvingEmotionParadox2006; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003]. On the other hand, from a multipurpose point of view -- which is in and on itself a form of generalization -- the link with a *scientific*, theory-driven perspective presents several advantages.

First, by mapping the tool to a prescriptive definition, emotion not only emerges according to what it *is*, but also according to what it *does* and why. As seen in the previous chapter, there is a growing body of literature focusing on the functional role emotion plays both at the intra- and inter-personal levels [@adolphsInvestigatingEmotionsFunctional2018; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999; @levensonIntrapersonalFunctionsEmotion1999; @leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987]. Thus, a theory-driven perspective may contribute to better assemble these functions and take full advantage of them in the implementation of the EAT [@broschAppraisingBrainNeuroCognitive2013; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018].

Second, tailoring an EAT on emotion theory may contribute to guide learners in discovering and using it, since they can be both interested and reassured by identifying underlying mechanisms that are thought to be an integral part of the phenomenon [@tranEmotionsDecisionMakingProcesses2012]. The fact that a dedicated tool is provided in the environment for some *corollary* activities does not automatically mean that it will be adopted [@kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003].

Third, from a research perspective, linking the EAT to a theory facilitates the assessment and comparison of measures collected through or about it, and therefore foster common ground in the contributions that shall decide to adopt it [@izardManyMeaningsAspects2010; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. In the meantime, the EAT would also benefit from the upcoming theoretical and applied contributions in the literature that relate to the shared emotion theory, ensuring the tool can progress over time, or otherwise be dismissed if some competing theory provides a better alternative [@fergusonVastGraveyardUndead2012; @meehlAppraisingAmendingTheories1990].

These reasons advocate the adoption of a theory-driven approach to the definition of the emotion *unit* to be implemented into the EAT. The next section will thus address the topic of emotion theories.

## Theories of Emotion {#theories-of-emotion}

As one may expect from the complexity in defining an emotion outlined in the previous section, there are a multitude of emotion theories and taxonomies that try to categorize them [see for example @moorsTheoriesEmotionCausation2009; @sep-emotion; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013]. Adopting a perspective spanning philosophy and affective sciences, Scarantino and de Sousa [-@sep-emotion] identify three traditions in which most of emotion theories may belong: (1) the Feeling Tradition, which considers the conscious experience of an emotion as the fundamental characteristic; (2) the Evaluative Tradition, which focuses on how emotion consists in, or is crucially defined by the way eliciting events are evaluated; and (3) the Motivational Tradition, which identifies emotion with specific internal states driven by want or need to satisfy a goal.

In psychology more specifically, the last decades have been characterized mainly by three major families of emotion theories that account for the *whole* emotional phenomenon (*i.e.*, elicitation and response): (1) basic emotion theories [@ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992; @ekmanWhatMeantCalling2011; @huttoNewBetterBET2018; @keltnerEmotionalExpressionAdvances2019], stemming from the assumption that there exist a fixed number of discrete, *primary* emotions, each of them presenting a fixed pattern of elicitation and response (2) constructivist/dimensional emotion theories [@russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @russellEmotionCoreAffect2009; @stanleyTwodimensionalAffectiveSpace2009], driven from a dimensional approach to emotion, in which a persistent core affect is determined by a bi-polar combination of physiological arousal (*e.g.*, activating vs. deactivating) and psychological assessment of the perceived valence of events (*e.g.*. pleasant vs. unpleasant); and (3) appraisal emotion theories [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985], in which discrete emotion are determined by the ongoing, cognitive evaluation of events on a number of (dimensional) criteria. These three families emerged from different historical backgrounds, and their foundation are often rooted in philosophical perspectives with secular traditions. In *psychological* era, we can trace back seminal works on the three families in the second half of the last century [@arnoldEmotionPersonalityPsychological1960; @lazarusPsychologicalStressCoping1966; @russellCircumplexModelAffect1980; @schererEmotionProcessFunction1982]. Since then, theories have influenced each other, converging on some points -- most notably the fact that emotion is not unitary but comprises different components -- and maintaining different positions on other points, such as eliciting and differentiation mechanisms in discrete emotions [@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013]. New and often interdisciplinary theories that have emerged lately resume and extend some ideas of one or more of these families. It is the case, for instance, of the *enacting* approach proposed by Colombetti [-@colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014], which bestow to emotion, from a phenomenological perspective, a more *active* role compared to the *passive* response to events that is sometimes implied by some emotion theories. Another example is represented by the *theory of affective pragmatics* proposed by Scarantino [-@scarantinoHowThingsEmotional2017], which pursue the idea of the existence of emotion as natural kinds, as in basic emotion theories. In other cases, such as in the *theory of constructed emotion* advocated by Feldman Barrett [@barrettHowEmotionsAre2018; @barrettSolvingEmotionParadox2006; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017], there is considerable discontinuity with previous work, challenging the principle according to which emotions are responses or exist as natural kinds. For instance, Feldman Barret [-@barrettHowEmotionsAre2018, p. vii-viii] argues that "[e]motion are real, but not in the objective sense that molecules or neurons are real. They are real in the same sense that money is real -- that is, hardly an illusion, but a product of human agreement". Some contributions have also attempted to highlight common grounds rather than distinction between theories [@scherer2022], or adopt a theory-independent perspective and rather focus on empirical contributions by investigating the accuracy in making predictions about the emotion experienced by a person in a controlled environment [@schererEmotionProcessEvent2019].

A second important choice in the implementation of a theory-driven EAT is therefore to define which emotion theory or set of theories it relates to. At present, no emotion theory provides clear and undisputed supremacy in terms of explanatory power of what an emotion is [@sep-emotion; @scherer2022; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @moorsTheoriesEmotionCausation2009; @scarantinoPhilosophyEmotionsIts2018]. As a consequence, the choice of the theory may be assessed rather in functional terms: which tradition/theory may provide the best framework to foster emotional awareness? The present contribution makes the opinionated assumption that the Evaluative Tradition, and more specifically appraisal theories of emotion, may best fit this purpose. It is posited by this choice that an EAT may convey instrumental information to learners, if that information is crucially determined by how learners construe emotion meaning from the situation at hand, an assumption also shared by other scholars investigating the relationship between emotion and learning [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014]. The next section offers an overview of this family of emotion theories.

## Appraisal Theories of Emotion {#appraisal-theories}

Appraisal theories of emotion originated in the 1960's with the work of Arnold [-@arnoldEmotionPersonalityPsychological1960] and Lazarus [-@lazarusPsychologicalStressCoping1966] and were then formalized in the 1980's by independent scholars reaching similar conclusions about the need to explain how different emotions may be elicited by the same event, for different persons and in different situations [@schererEmotionProcessFunction1982; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985; @schorrAppraisalEvolutionIdea2001; @rosemanAppraisalTheoryOverview2001; @siemerSameSituationdifferentEmotions2007]. The core element shared by theories belonging to the appraisal family is resumed by the premise that emotions "are adaptive responses which reflect appraisals of features of the environment that are significant for the organism's well-being" [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013, p. 119], where well-being roughly encompasses the satisfaction or obstruction of someone's wants, needs or goals that are considered of major concern [@frijdaEmotions1986; @rosemanAppraisalTheoryOverview2001; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. This feature is nevertheless not unique to appraisal theories, since other theories reckon adaptive functions to emotion or motivational implications [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992; @scarantinoHowThingsEmotional2017; @sep-emotion]. Appraisal theories are therefore more thoroughly characterized by the dynamic, recurrent and ongoing nature they confer to emotion in sustaining the adaptive response [@broschAppraisingBrainNeuroCognitive2013; @oatleyCognitiveApproachesEmotions2014; @rosemanAppraisalTheoryOverview2001; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schorrAppraisalEvolutionIdea2001; @siemerSameSituationdifferentEmotions2007]. It is in fact common among appraisal theories to consider emotion as a process, rather than a state (*ibid.*). The bounded process unfolds over brief periods of time and can be modified in light of new information coming from any of the organismic subsystems or components, which include "an appraisal component with evaluations of the environment and the person-environment interaction; a motivational component with action tendencies or other forms of action readiness; a somatic component with peripheral physiological responses; a motor component with expressive and instrumental behavior; and a feeling component with subjective experience or feelings" [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013, pp. 119-120].

An example of an appraisal theory is Pekrun's Control-Value theory of achievement emotions [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006], already sketched in Section \@ref(learning-on-affect). In Pekrun's own words (*ibid*, p. 317):

> The control-value theory described here posits that two groups of appraisals are of specific relevance for achievement emotions: (1) *subjective control* over achievement activities and their outcomes (e.g., expectations that persistence at studying can be enacted, and that it will lead to success); and (2) the *subjective values* of these activities and outcomes (e.g., the perceived importance of success).

What emotion a learner will feel in an achievement context, such as studying for a test, will depend on the specific pattern emerging from the combination of appraising the subjective control and the subjective value. For instance, "[i]f an achievement activity (e.g., studying) and the material to which it relates (e.g., learning material) are positively valued, and if the activity is perceived as being sufficiently controllable by the self, *enjoyment* is assumed to be instigated" (*ibid.*, p. 323). Conversely, "[i]f the activity is perceived as being controllable, but is negatively valued (e.g., when effort required by the activity is experienced as aversive), *anger* is expected to be aroused. If the activity is not sufficiently controllable, *frustration* will be experienced" (*ibid*, p. 323, all italics in the text).

According to the dynamic, recursive and ongoing nature of emotion posited by appraisal theories, then, the evaluation of the activity may change instantly. For instance, the learning material may be perceived as too difficult at first, lowering learners' subjective control, but become clearer after a synthesis or a figure. Likewise, the subjective value may suddenly arise if, after reading a few pages useless to one's needs, the learner finds a passage she can directly apply to solve a problem that has been bothering her ever since. Conversely, the very same passage may be considered of scarce value from her colleague, who has already solved the problem beforehand.

The Control-Value theory of achievement emotions may therefore seem to be a valid candidate to guide the implementation of an appraisal-driven EAT, but it only partially comply with the multipurpose vocation. In fact, learning is characterized by different *kinds* of emotion, which comprise, but are not limited to, achievement emotions. As illustrated in Section \@ref(learning-on-affect), Pekrun and Linnerbrink-Garcia [-@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014] reckon that learning also triggers epistemic emotions, topic emotions, and social emotions. An overarching appraisal theory would therefore be more suitable to a multipurpose EAT. In this regard, appraisal theories, even if they share considerable overlapping, differ on several key points, which are enumerated in a state of the art proposed by @moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013. Most of the points are too detailed for the present purpose and the complete list would lack instrumental information to be fully explained. Only the points concerning appraisal criteria are considered to be of primary relevance and will thus be extrapolated from the aforementioned source.

As a reminder, appraisal is considered a process that scans events outside or inside the organism and evaluates them against a set of criteria related to the organism's major concern. One of the main source of divergence in appraisal theories refers, precisely, to the number of appraisal criteria the event is evaluated against, the order of evaluation, as well as the possible outcomes of every criterion. An appraisal criterion can have dimensional, ordinal or categorical values. For instance, the Control-Value theory described above [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006] considers that the two appraisals Control and Value can assume ordinal values *none*, *low*, *medium* and *high*. Other appraisal theories postulate dimensional criteria, with potentially infinite values along a continuum, or categorical criteria, with a predefined set of possible values. As stated by @moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013:

> The number and nature of the appraisal variables and/or values is closely related to the number and nature of the emotions that one can or wishes to explain. In general, more emotions require more appraisal variables and/or more appraisal values. Turning it around, more appraisal variables and/or more appraisal values allow more variety in emotions. Two appraisal variables with two values each can account for four emotions. Seven appraisal variables with an infinite number of values each can account for an infinite number of emotions. The number and nature of the emotions that one wishes to explain can be traced back to metatheoretical choices such as whether one strives for parsimony and/or a focus on natural language descriptors of emotions, on the one hand, or exhaustiveness and/or a focus on variety, on the other hand.\
> --- @moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013, p. 121-122

This contribution adopts the Component Process Model theoretical framework [@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005] as the emotion theory of reference for reasons that will be illustrated in the next section, alongside a description of the model.

## The Component Process Model Theoretical Framework {#cpm-section}

The Component Process Model (CPM) is a theoretical framework bridging appraisal and componential approaches to emotion, first proposed by Scherer [-@schererEmotionProcessFunction1982] in the 1980's and then refined over the years [-@schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013; -@schererWhatAreEmotions2005; -@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; -@schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009]. It has been applied to different contexts: the reader may find discussions of the model in relation with learning and education in @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014, with affective computing in @schererBlueprintAffectiveComputing2010, with emotional meaning-making in @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013, with emotional competence/intelligence in @schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007, and with neuroscience in @sanderAppraisalDrivenComponentialApproach2018. An overarching and accessible description of the model can be found in @schererWhatAreEmotions2005, whereas @schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001 and @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009 are more focused on the dynamic, recurrent and ongoing features of the model. Finally, more recent developments are discussed in @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013, @scherer2019 and @scherer2022. The choice of the CPM as the main theoretical source for the implementation of an emotion structure into an EAT is warranted by the following reasons.

First, the model encompasses the whole process of emotion elicitation, manifestation, and representation in oneself [@sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013] and can be extended to mechanisms in others [@vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018; @rimeEmotionElicitsSocial2009; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016]. It is therefore consistent both with the intra-personal assumption of emotional awareness illustrated in Section \@ref(ea-intra-personal), and with the inter-personal assumption depicted in Section \@ref(ea-intra-personal).

Second, the model draws a clear distinction between different affective phenomena. This is particularly relevant for contextual reasons. Pekrun and Linnerbrink-Garcia [@pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014, p. 2], namely, point out that "[i]n the broader education literature, affect is often used to denote a broad variety of noncognitive constructs including emotion but also including self-concept, beliefs, motivation, and so on [...]. In contrast, in emotion research, affect refers to emotions and moods more specifically". As depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:emotion-vs-other-affective-phenomena), the CPM considers emotion: strongly event focused and driven by appraisal (i.e., elicited by an event that can be identified and evaluated), of relatively brief duration, subject to abrupt changes, and with the potential of being regulated.

(ref:emotion-vs-other-affective-phenomena-caption) Comparison between features of different affective phenomena, retrieved from @scherer2022, Table 1 in the original article, p. 158.

```{r emotion-vs-other-affective-phenomena, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:emtion-vs-other-affective-phenomena-caption)", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figure/theory/emotion-vs-other-affective-phenomena.png"))
```

Third, the model bestow to the subjective experience of the emotional episode a central role in extrapolating meaning-making both at the individual and interpersonal levels [@grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. This is consistent with an interactional approach to emotion [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007] illustrated in Section \@ref(interactional-approach-emotion).

Forth, the CPM can be related to emotional intelligence/competence in concrete, practical terms [@schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007]. As illustrated in Section \@ref(socio-affective-competences), socio-affective competences are one of the central areas of research bridging affective sciences and learning/education sciences.

Finally, the model is computational in nature [@schererBlueprintAffectiveComputing2010]. A computational model of emotion [@marsella2010] may be helpful in complying with the third main assumption of emotional awareness of Section \@ref(ea-in-computer-mediated-environment), namely that emotional awareness can be fruitfully conveyed in a computer-mediated learning environment.

This section first proposes an overview of the model and its components according to the objectives of the thesis by combining a computational [@schererComponentProcessModel2010], emotion meaning-making [@schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018] and voluntary self-report [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005] perspectives. Then, it provides further information on 3 *modules* that can be interpreted in an Input/Output process.

### Overall Description of the Model

The CPM adopts a functional perspective according to which "[e]motions have developed in the course of evolution to replace rigid instincts or stimulus-response chains by a mechanism that allows flexible adaptation to environmental contingencies by decoupling stimulus and response, creating a latency time for response optimization" [@schererComponentProcessModel2010, p. 48]. Response optimization emerges as the result from the synchronization of five organismic subsystems performing specific functions. The state of each subsystem during an emotion episode corresponds to one of the five components of the model, namely: (1) the cognitive, (2) the neurophysiological, (3) the motivational, (4) the motor expression, and (5) the subjective feeling components. According to the CPM, thus, an emotion is defined as "*an episode of interrelated, synchronized changes in the states of all or most of the five organismic subsystems in response to the evaluation of an external or internal stimulus event as relevant to major concerns of the organism*" [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005, p. 697, italic in the text]. The emotional experience therefore starts when at least three of the subsystems reach a certain threshold of synchronization, and ends when the synchronization falls below this level again.

The CPM belongs to the appraisal family of emotion theories because it states that the coordination and synchronization of the components during an emotion episode is driven by the cognitive evaluation of the situation, that is, by how the situation is subjectively appraised by the person [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. The five components intertwine so that a variation in one fo them may lead to modifications in others, modifying thus the net effect of the coordination and synchronization. As stated by Scherer [-@schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013]:

> Briefly put, the CPM suggests that the event and its consequences are appraised with a set of criteria on multiple levels of processing, producing a motivational effect or action tendency that often changes or at least modifies the status quo. Specifically, the appraisal results and the concomitant motivational changes will produce efferent effects in the autonomic nervous system (in the form of somatovisceral changes), and motor expressions are centrally represented and constantly fused in a multimodal integration area (with continuous updating as events and appraisals change). Parts of this central integrated representation may then become conscious and subject to assignment to fuzzy emotion categories, as well as being labeled with emotion words, expressions, or metaphors\
> --- @schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013, p. 13

The process can be understood in terms of input/output when the model is organized in three modules, as graphically represented in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-cpm-general-model-adapted-caption), adapted from @schererComponentProcessModel2010:

1.  the appraisal module

2.  the response-patterning module

3.  the integration/categorization module

From the left-hand side of the model, an event, behavior or situation (the input) is subject to a multilevel appraisal; it is cognitively evaluated against a number of appraisal criteria. This evaluation leads to the patterning of a response, which comprises three out of the five organismic subsystems: (a) the motivational component, which prepares the organism to action, even if this action is not necessarily executed; (b) the neurophysiological component, which orchestrates the allocation of resources according to the action tendency; and (c) the motor expression component, which is responsible of the emergence of the underlying process to the *surface* via efferent manifestations, providing communicative cues, such as facial expressions, vocal prosody, or body postures. Finally, in the integration/categorization module on the right-hand side, the whole process -- that is, the net effect of the appraisal and response-patterning -- is integrated in a central representation, the feeling, of which the person may or may not be conscious. If she is conscious, the person may recur to her knowledge about features of emotion or her emotional lexicon in an effort to extrapolate a symbolic representation of the feeling, which in that case becomes the subjective feeling: the conscious output of the whole process.

```

After a brief overview of the overall model, the next subsections focus on the three modules respectively.

### The Appraisal Module: Appraisals as Sequential Evaluation Checks {#cpm-appraisal-module}

The appraisal module may be considered the most characteristic of the CPM for two intertwined reasons. First, it bridges cognition and emotion in a functional perspective [@leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987], avoiding thus the pitfalls of the opposition between affect and cognition, which recent developments in affective science are progressively dismissing in favor of interacting or even integrating perspectives [@dukesRiseAffectivism2021; @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013]. Second, it plays a pivotal role in differentiating the CPM from other appraisal theories, for the CPM makes bold assumptions about how distinctive appraisal patterns lead to distinctive emotional episodes [@schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererHumanEmotionExperiences2013; @schererStudyingEmotionantecedentAppraisal1993; @schererEmotionProcessEvent2019]. In other words, the model explicitly assumes a causal mechanism instantiated by the appraisal module, which determines the unfolding emotional episode in terms of response-patterning and integration/categorization.

The CPM's appraisal module is built around the central notion of Sequential Evaluation Checks (SECs): a set of appraisal criteria the event, situation or behavior is evaluated against [@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013]. According to the CPM, these appraisal criteria may not only be enumerated, but also determined with respect to their timing in achieving *preliminary closure* in information processing, that is, before the result of the evaluation can be integrated by other SECs or components of the model in the unfolding emotional process [@schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013]. The CPM identifies a total of 13 SECs, listed in Table \@ref(tab:tf-cpm-secs), which can be grouped in correspondence with four major appraisal objectives in adapting to a given event [@schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013]:

-   *Relevance*: how relevant is this event for me?
-   *Implications/Consequences*: what are the implications or consequences of this event and how do they affect my well-being and my immediate or long-term goals?
-   *Coping potential*: how well can I cope with or adjust to these consequences?
-   *Normative significance*: what is the significance of this event for my self-concept and for social norms and value?

```

The evaluation of SECs can be executed at four levels of processing, which can be ranked with respect to the complexity*,* consciousness of the undergoing evaluation, and involvement of other phenomena or processes [@schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013]: (a) a sensorimotor level, (b) a schematic level, (c) an association level, and (d) a conceptual level. Of the four levels, the last two better comply with the use of an EAT because they are more related with higher-order cognitive processing. In particular, the conceptual level requires consciousness of the underlying evaluation and effort-full calculation in the pre-frontal cortex (*ibid.*), which are aligned with the view of an EAT as a self-reflecting and emotional experience enhancer.

Furthermore, appraisal criteria are also bidirectionally linked with cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and reasoning, as well as motivational factors and self-concepts [@sanderSystemsApproachAppraisal2005], as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-cpm-full-process). As a consequence, the specific appraisal pattern that emerges is determined by situational factors, but also by more stable structures that can lead to certain patterns to emerge more or less frequently, for instance the tendency of a student to avoid confrontation of point of views as a result of past experiences [@scherer2021]. In the meantime, the fact that many elements concur in determining the specific appraisal profile implies that an evaluation may cause the emotional episode to derail from adaptive binaries and lead to inefficient or even harming responses to events, as in the case of excessive anxiety or fear in taking an exam [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014]. The CPM also implies that the emotion components have links with cognitive processes (*i.e.*, the red *backward* arrows in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-cpm-full-process), which contributes to explain why emotion may influence for instance perception, attention, memory and decision-making [*e.g.*, @broschImpactEmotionPerception2013] -- that is, processes also pivotal to learning.

(ref:tf-cpm-full-process-caption) Comprehensive illustration of the component process model of emotion. Retrieved from the original Figure 1 in @sanderSystemsApproachAppraisal2005, p. 321. Please note that the *conducivness* SEC does not appear in the more recent list provided by Scherer [-@schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013] and illustrated above.

knitr::include_graphics(here("figure/theory/cpm-full-process.png"))
```

To sum up, in the CPM appraisal criteria play a prominent role in emotion elicitation and differentiation. As a consequence, an EAT could leverage on the pivotal role of SECs to foster emotional awareness, for instance advocating the cognitive evaluation of the salient event. In other words, the EAT could contribute to make sure that emotion is assessed at the conceptual level -- the one implicating consciousness and effort-full calculations -- as a means to extrapolate meaning-making from the adaptive objectives of appraisal criteria.

### The Response-Patterning Module {#cpm-patterning-module}

The response-patterning module build upon information provided by sequential evaluation checks (SECs) described in previous subsection and is responsible for the e*mbodiement* of emotion in terms of adaptation [@schererEmotionProcessEvent2019]. Adaptive reactions can be designated at two levels: (1) intra-individual, with the regulation of the organism's functions (neurophysiological component) and the action tendencies (motivational component); and (2) inter-individual, through the motor expression component, which comprises efferent manifestations such as facial expression, vocal prosody or body posture playing an important communicative role [see @hyniewskaNaturalisticEmotionDecoding2019; @schererFacialExpressionsAllow2007; @shumanEmotionPerceptionComponential2017 from a componential perspective].

From the point of view of an EAT, emotional awareness from the response-patterning would require dedicated hardware/software both at the intra-individual (*e.g.*, heart-rate detection, skin conductance, ...) and inter-individual level (audio/video connection, autonomic emotion recognition from facial expression, ...). As stated in the introduction, even though these techniques exist and are currently deployed in emotional awareness research in computer-mediated environments, they are not considered for the purpose of the present contribution. It is interesting to point out, though, that a growing body of research considers efferent manifestations as cues of underlying appraisals [@scherer2018; @scherer2007; @mumenthaler2012; @parkinson2013]. People may therefore infer from efferent manifestations of emotion what kind of evaluation the person is doing of the situation, which then determines the whole emotional episode. This view is consistent with Van Kleef's functional equivalence hypothesis [@vankleefSocialEffectsEmotions2017] illustrated in the previous chapter. In other words, if people are provided with alternative appraisal cues, the social function of the expression may be considered functionally equivalent.

The action tendency component, on the other hand, is of central concern from an emotional awareness perspective. In fact, according to the CPM, emotion predisposes the organism to act in a certain way, even though the course of action may be blocked or redefined before the concrete execution. @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014 provide some examples with respect to learning:

> For example, feeling curious is associated with approach rather than avoidant behavior. At the same time, as action tendencies are not actions (i.e., overt behavior), one has some flexibility to decide whether or not to carry out the action. This decoupling of stimulus and response distinguishes emotions from reflexes and allows for greater behavioral flexibility. For example, in a classroom, students sometimes need to wait before they can ask their questions. The action tendency associated with curiosity motivates students to ask questions, but it does not dictate that they immediately do so. Similarly, when feeling fear before a test for which one is not prepared, a student needs to suppress the urge to avoid the test and overcome the fear instead by, for example, studying for the test to increase her coping potential.\
> --- @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014, p. 17

In some important ways, we can derive that emotional awareness is connected to the process of inferring and, if needed, regulate action tendencies in oneself or others. At the same time, the action tendency component has received so far limited attention compared to the other components [@scherer2019; @scherer2022]. For instance, Shuman and Scherer (*ibid.*) reckon that epistemic emotions may not be associated to a particular action tendency or adaptive function.

To sum up, even though the Response-Patterning module plays a prominent role in emotion differentiation and has also consequences on behavior especially through action tendencies, its intrinsic nature as well as the need for dedicated hardware and software complicate its transposition in an EAT. As a consequences, elements provided by this module may have to be inferred from contextual or background knowledge by the learner.

### The Integration/Categorization Module: Subjective Feeling As Emotion Meaning Making {#subjetive-feeling}

The integration/categorization module may be considered the *output* of the CPM, because it coalesces information from all the other components into a conscious emotional experience, which can be used to monitor the emotional experience in the person. In fact, the CPM considers the subjective feeling "a holistic cognitive representation that integrates the temporarily coordinated changes of the other components [...], allowing the individual to reach awareness of his/her state and label it -- stating that he/she 'has' or 'feels' a particular emotion" [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013, p. 281]. Contrary to other interpretations of what an emotion is, which requires consciousness for emotion to exist [@ledouxHigherorderTheoryEmotional2017; @liebermanBooConsciousnessProblem2019], according to the CPM the subjective feeling does not necessarily emerge to consciousness, nor fully represents the *true* emotional episode [@schererEmotionProcessEvent2019]. On the contrary, as depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-cpm-subjective-feeling-caption), the subjective feeling emerges from the intersection of (A) unconscious, (B) conscious, and (C) semantic/communicative processes.

(ref:tf-cpm-subjective-feeling-caption) The subjective feeling as the central representation of the other CPM's components. The three circles of the Venn diagram show that a valid zone of self-report does not *overlap* with the underlying integration (circle A), nor the intra-personal conscious representation (circle B). Retrieved from @grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008, Figure 3 in the original article at p. 487.

```{r tf-cpm-subjective-feeling-caption, fig.align="center", fig.cap="(ref:tf-cpm-subjective-feeling-caption)", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figure/theory/cpm-subjective-feeling.jpg"))
```

As the schema illustrates, a virtual *zone of valid self-report* does not completely overlap with the *true* phenomena, meaning that a person can potentially verbalize or communicate (circle C) a subjective feeling that is not representative either or neither of the *true qualia* of circle A or the conscious representation of it represented by circle B. For instance, the person may fail to integrate the whole *signals* from the components in circle A, and therefore not *feel* the episode in spite of the organism experiencing it. This will result in not reporting an emotion. Another possibility is that the person consciously attributes to the *true qualia* a different representation from the *original signal* (circle B), as in the case of interpreting excitement for collaborating with a new colleague as fear. Finally, (circle C) the person may be unable to verbalize her emotion or communicate a different emotion from the one experienced due to confusion or lack of emotion-related vocabulary, as in communicating *frustration* rather than *anger*.

The conscious subjective feeling is therefore tightly related with how the emotion experience is translated into a symbolic representation that can be named, communicated, and operated upon for emotion meaning-making: a lexicalized emotion [@ogarkovaFolkEmotionConcepts2013]. The combinatorial nature of appraisals in the CPM entails a potential infinite number of emotional experiences. At the same time, it is posited that some combinations are more likely, or more recurrent to occur in everyday life. These patterns -- often named *modal emotions* in the CPM -- are therefore also more likely to be encoded into the language, for them to be readily accessible in intra-individual or inter-individual symbolic transactions. In this view, commonly adopted emotion words such as *joy*, *anger*, or *surprise* are representative of frequently experienced synchronized patterns. In the meantime, these frequent patterns are nor finite in number, nor forcefully universally shared by all human beings. Due to personal or cultural influences, a pattern can be lexicalized in different manner, or even dispose of a lexical unit in one language but not in another. As a consequence, the conscious subjective feeling in one person is a non-deterministic representation of the underlying *true* episode which is determined at least by (a) the frequency of occurrence of that pattern in the culture/language of reference, and (b) accurate association of that pattern with the frequently adopted lexicalized emotion by the person.

Despite the fact that the integration/categorization module may potentially be misleading with respect to the *true* underlying episode, the CPM subsumes a probabilistic link between the cognitive evaluation of the situation and the resulting conscious subjective feeling. As stated by Scherer [-@schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009]:

> if one knows the results of an individual's event appraisal on major checks, one can approximately predict what kind of emotion he or she will most likely experience (or more precisely, what label the person is likely to use to refer to the experience).\
> -- @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009, p. 1326

In this view, Scherer and Meuleman [-@schererHumanEmotionExperiences2013], used an expert system to measure to what extent it was possible to predict from the CPM's appraisals the subjective feeling experienced by a person. In the test, participants were asked to self-report their appraisals of some situations and provide the subjective feeling(s) they had experienced. Using the self-reported appraisals alone, the system predicted what kind of subjective feeling(s) the participant may have experienced and then matched the results with the one(s) actually reported by participants. Results showed a predictive accuracy by the expert system above 50% for an exact match, and of 90% for a partial correct or appropriate label. An interesting finding of the same contribution concerns participants' need to use, often, more than one subjective feelings to correctly represent their emotional experience, which corroborates how verbalization/communication (circle C) may not completely overlap with the *true* underlying phenomenon.

Further evidence for the central role of appraisal dimensions in the integration/categorization of emotion meaning is provided by studies adopting the GRID instrument [@fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013]. The GRID is a web-based questionnaire that is organized around 142 or 144 emotion characteristics, representing columns of the grid, each one pertaining to one of the five CPM's components. Each row can be represented by one lexicalized emotion. Participants can thus rate this semantic word according to how likely a person in their culture is to manifest each of the characteristics of the emotion. The *profile* that emerges from the combination of rows and columns can then be adopted in different analyses and for different purposes [@fontaineWorldEmotionsNot2007; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018; @gentschEffectsAchievementContexts2017; @fontaineWorldEmotionsNot2007].

Fontaine and colleagues [-@fontaineWorldEmotionsNot2007], for instance, adopted the GRID instrument in a cross-cultural studies using 24 prototypical emotion words in 3 languages. Using a principal component analysis (PCA), the author found evidence for the need of 4 underlying dimensions to account for similarities and differences between emotion words. The authors identified these dimensions as evaluation-pleasantness, potency-control, activation-arousal, and unpredictability. A similar, but more comprehensive study, conducted this time in over 20 languages and countries yielded corroborating results [@fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013]. The authors found evidence for a four-dimensional structure, with the four factors identified as *Valence*, *Power*, *Arousal*, and *Novelty*. Gillioz and colleagues [-@gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016] extended the analysis to 80 emotion terms and confirmed the emergence of a four-dimensional structure with the same aforementioned factors. Incidentally, one of the advantages of the GRID instrument is that the PCA projects the emotion words into an affective space characterized by the underlying dimensions, a feature that will be of central importance in the EAT proposed in this contribution.

Scherer and Fontaine [-@schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018] performed a secondary analysis on the large datasets from over 20 languages and countries [@fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013] with the specif intention to test whether the feeling component factors may be explained by the appraisal components, and whether the response-patterning factors played a mediating function. The author found evidence that the appraisal components explained the results of the subjective feeling components, and that the effect was almost fully mediated by the response-patterning components. In other words, when one knows the appraisal profile, the response-patterning adds little value to the explanation.

Finally, Gentsch and colleagues [-@gentschEffectsAchievementContexts2017] adopted the GRID and a modified version, the Achievement Emotion CoreGRID, to test whether the semantic structure of emotion words may be influenced by contextual factors, for instance a general, non-contextual situation vs. an achievement situation characterized by either failure or success. The authors suggest that their analysis confirms the emergence of a four-dimensional structure with the same factors (*Valence*, *Power*, *Arousal* and *Novelty*), which is consistent regardless of the general or achievement context. On the other hand, specific features of emotion were rated differently depending on the context. More specifically, the appraisal components ratings were the ones more likely to be affected by the context, which is aligned with appraisal theories' central tenets. It is worth noting, tough, that Gentsch and colleagues (*ibid.*) adopted a MANOVA followed by post-hoc uni-dimensional t-test according to the significance of the multivariate test, a practice whose validity is subject to critics [@warnePrimerMultivariateAnalysis2014].

To sum up, there is consistent evidence of a direct link between appraisal criteria and the holistic, conscious subjective feeling, which integrate the whole phenomenon. This link is particularly evident when the subjective feeling is represented by a lexicalized emotion: a word carrying semantic emotional meaning. The link is nevertheless probabilistic in nature, and can be influenced by contextual as well as individual characteristics such as emotion knowledge, emotional vocabulary, or culture. At the same time, lexicalized emotion can also be projected into affective spaces determined by dimensions driven by a componential approach. In this regard, there is consistent evidence that four dimensions are necessary to account for the differentiation of emotional experience.

## Emotional Competence from a Componential Perspective {#emotional-competence-cpm}

The adoption of the CPM as the framework of reference presents another interesting aspects: disposing of an underlying mechanism upon which the overarching concept of *emotional expertise* as defined by @hoemann2021 can be clarified. In fact, Scherer [@schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007] proposes to adopt the term *emotional competence* and postulates that this phenomena can be informed by the CPM.

Scherer defines emotional competence as "the capacity that is at issue, varying over individuals, as differential degrees of *competence in using the emotion mechanism* as it has been shaped by evolution" [@schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007, p. 102, italics in the text]. The term competence is considered at an intermediate level in a continuum represented by relatively stable traits, such as abilities, on the one side, and more specific and contextualized skills on the other side. This conceptualization is consistent with other scholars considering advantages inherited by some form of emotional know-how as malleable, especially through training [*e.g.*, @mayerAbilityModelEmotional2016]. Emotional competence can be divided in two major domains: emotion production and emotion perception. The two are then further characterized by three sub-competences: 1) the appraisal competence, (2) the communication competence, and (3) the regulation competence.

### Appraisal Competence {#appraisal-competence}

The appraisal competence consists in emotion elicitation and emotion differentiation [@schererEmotionProcessEvent2019]. On the one hand, a competent emotional agent is able to detect features of the environment that may benefit from an emotional response. For a student, for instance, it is important to rapidly detect events that are central to the learning process such as novel and relevant information; interactions with colleagues that may lead to unpleasant consequences; concepts that exceeds one's coping potential in processing them; or behaviors that violates norms of conduct such as plagiarism.

The detection of emotion-eliciting events is nevertheless not enough to unfold the *most adequate* response. Emotional differentiation consists thus in the generation of a *valid* appraisal profile, where valid stands for a profile that is most likely to generate an adaptive emotion. For instance, detecting that the content of a lesson is exceeding one's coping potential may lead to confusion or boredom, with the former most likely to enhance cognitive re-equilibrium, whereas the latter may trigger abandoning altogether [@bakerBetterBeFrustrated2010; @dmelloConfusionCanBe2014]. Emotion differentiation is tightly related with the idea that even if there is no emotion that is intrinsically positive or negative for learning, there is an emotion that is more instrumental to learning processes or outcomes at a given moment, with a given appraisal profile.

At the same time, there may be learners that are more or less inclined to experience some emotions more frequently than others. @scherer2021, for instance, has gathered empirical evidence suggesting that an *appraisal bias* -- that is, a stable tendency, often dysfunctional or unrealistic, to evaluate events in similar ways -- may be at the core of emotion dispositions. The intervening role of appraisal criteria may in this sense provide a more fine-grained causal mechanisms compared to the more unspecified idea of affective traits (*ibid.*).

An EAT may thus sustain or elicit appropriate appraisal of a situation and emotional differentiation by providing learners with a set of criteria against which events may be evaluated. The appropriate emotional response in learning settings, though, may be more difficult to establish compared to situations in which the well-being of the organism is more directly implicated. According to Shuman and Scherer [-@shumanEmotionPerceptionComponential2017, p.14] "emotions can be good or bad for learning depending on how similar requirements posed to us in modern situations are to demands for survival in the past". This kind of similarity may require a more abstract, meta-cognitive and conceptual evaluation of the situation at hand, and an EAT may in this sense be adaptable to appraisals that are more likely to occur given the specifics of the learning activity.

### Communication Competence

The communication competence is two-fold. On the production side, it concerns the expression of a strategic signal that maximizes correct interpretation from others, minimizing ambiguous inferences. The signal may be verbal or non-verbal, but in both cases, it is in an emotionally competent agent's interest to make others aware of her emotional episode, for it has been triggered by an important event. For instance, it is in a student's interest to express her *contempt* towards a free-rider, for this behavior to cease; or *gratitude* towards an helping colleague, for this behavior to repeat in case of need.

On the perception side, the communication competence extends on inter-individual settings, by requiring accurate decoding of the strategic signal emitted by another person. As posited by the Emotion As Social Information framework [@vankleefEmergingViewEmotion2010; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018], accurate interpretation of emotional signals are valuable information both for inferring causes and consequences of behavior in others, but also for the person herself.

An EAT may therefore play a prominent role in facilitating the communication of the most accurate strategic signal from the emitter to the decoder. At the same time, it may also train learners to improve their emotion communication competence, for instance by widening the *toolbox* of strategic signals that may be sent or received [@erbasRoleValenceFocus2015].

### Regulation Competence

From an appraisal driven perspective, emotion regulation may be seen as an additional evaluation layer, which for once does not evaluate the situation *per se*, but rather the emotional response that has been produced. According to Scherer [-@schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007], one of the central functions of emotion regulation is to avoid the persistence of emotion that have been triggered by inappropriate evaluation of the situation. This mechanism is particularly suited to appraisal theories, which advocates emotion as an ongoing process that may be refined over iterations in order to produce the *optimal* emotional response.

As seen in Section \@ref(socio-affective-competences), regulatory processes are central tenets of socio-emotional competences [@brackettRULERTheoryDrivenSystemic2019; @hoffmannTeachingEmotionRegulation2020] as well as the regulation, co-regulation and socially shared regulation of learning [@millerScriptingAwarenessTools2015; @jarvelaSociallySharedRegulation2016]. An EAT may therefore enhance regulation processes by providing information about how a situation has been appraised, augmenting the chances that both the learner herself and colleagues may assess to what extent the evaluation of the situation is congruent with the learning dynamics at stake.

## Summary

This chapter focused on the *emotion* noun of the Emotion Awarenss Tool acronym. The chapter first highlighted how difficult, but central, the definition of emotion is when emotional awareness may be produced at the intra-individual level and conveyed at the inter-individual level. The choice of appraisal theories of emotion and, more specifically, the Component Process Model as the framework of reference for defining an emotion has been motivated through the pivotal role of the cognitive evaluation performed by the person. Especially at the conceptual level, this evaluation may be central in determining (1) which emotion is elicited; (2) what is the most likely emotion word the person may associate to the episode for intra-individual meaning making or inter-individual strategic signalling; and (3) whether that emotion is *appropriate* given the learning dynamics at stake, that is, if it has been elicited *competently* by the learner, or some form of individual or social regulation is necessary. The link between appraisal dimensions, represented by a number of dimensional evaluation criteria, and a holistic conscious experience symbolized by a lexicalized emotion is therefore retained as the emotion structure to be implemented into an EAT. It is posited that both the intra-personal and inter-personal functions of emotional awareness in computer-mediated learning environments can best be served by building an EAT on the specific and testable causal mechanism in emotion elicitation, differentiation, communication and regulation provided by appraisal theories and the CPM more specifically. The cognitive evaluation of a situation at the conceptual level suggested by the CPM is considered a viable means to foster emotional meaning-making upon which learners can reflect and, if needed, act upon for self-regulation, co-regulation or socially shared regulation.

The upcoming Part II of the contribution will therefore focus on the implementation of an EAT that translates into concrete elements of a user interface the theoretical background illustrated in this first part.
