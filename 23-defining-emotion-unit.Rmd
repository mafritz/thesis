## What is an Emotion?

*What is an emotion?* is a question that literally appears in a multitude of scientific contributions. For instance, it is the title of a seminal article by William James [-@jamesWhatEmotion1884], which, despite being more than a century old, is still source of lively debate [@ellsworthWilliamJamesEmotion1994; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. There are many iconic statements that testify to the difficulty of studying emotions from a scientific perspective. Fehr and Russel [-@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984, p. 464] argued that "[e]veryone knows what an emotion is, until asked to give a definition", which resonates with Kleinginna and Kleinginna [-@kleinginnaCategorizedListEmotion1981], who, around the same time forty years ago, collected almost one hundred definitions. More recently, Frijda and Scherer [-@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009, p. 142] still confirmed that "emotion may be one of the fuzziest concepts in all of the sciences", which was empirically corroborated by Izard [-@izardManyMeaningsAspects2010], who attempted -- and failed -- to extrapolate a unitary definition from the responses of 35 leading researchers from different fields to 6 questions about emotion definition, function, activation and regulation.

Issues about the definition of emotion are rooted in historical, cultural and epistemological differences, within and across disciplines and approaches -- see @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003 and @plamperHistoryEmotionsIntroduction2015 for overarching perspectives, or @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013 for a more concise introduction. Some of the broader controversies regarding emotion can be encapsulated in onion layers that are highly interconnected and mutually influenced. From the outset to the inset, controversies may concern:

-   how emotion relates to, and differ from other phenomenon of the mind/body such as intelligence, rationality, consciousness or various forms of cognition [@broschImpactEmotionPerception2013; @leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987; @liebermanBooConsciousnessProblem2019; @rollsEmotionDecisionmakingExplained2014; @becharaRoleEmotionDecisionmaking2004; @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013; @murphyIntelligenceInterpersonalSensitivity2011; @saloveyEmotionalIntelligence1990];
-   how emotion relates to, and differ from other affective phenomena such as moods, preferences, attitudes, motivation, desires, feelings, sentiments, passions, and so on [@linnenbrink-garciaAdaptiveMotivationEmotion2016; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005; @dixonPassionsEmotionsCreation2003; @schwarz2003mood; @colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014];
-   whether there are, and what are the building blocks and features, covering the whole process from causation to consequences, shared by all phenomena identified as emotion [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @moorsTheoriesEmotionCausation2009; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985];
-   whether there are a countable number of, and how to distinguish between discrete emotions -- such as *anger*, *fear*, or *happiness* -- and if is it possible to categorize them in taxonomies [@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984; @fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013; @pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014; @scarantinoDonGiveBasic2011; @ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992]
-   how a specific emotion, assuming that a discrete emotion exists, should be referred to -- both from an everyday communication and scientific conceptualization points of view -- considering differences between cultures and languages [@ekmanWhatMeantCalling2011; @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @torrePuttingFeelingsWords2018; @grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008; @schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013; @douglas-cowieEmotionalSpeechNew2003].

The implementation of an EAT, especially one that has a multipurpose vocation, must therefore face the complexity of defining the *unit* that it aims to make people aware of [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007]. In this regard, a first, broad decision that shall be considered can be related to what Scarantino and de Sousa [-@sep-emotion] identify as the two *desiderata* of emotion definition. The first consists in shaping the definition of emotion in order to achieve compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage, which corresponds to a descriptive definition. The second aims at finding a definition of emotion that is theoretically fruitful, that is, a prescriptive definition. The two desiderata are not mutually exclusive, since even a prescriptive definition should try to maintain as much compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage as possible [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. But, in the case of incompatibility with ordinary intuition, a prescriptive definition should favor theoretical generalization [@scarantinoHowDefineEmotions2012]. Roughly translated in more concrete terms, a definition of emotion should guide the implementation of an EAT in deciding whether it shall convey what users consider an emotion to be from a *folk* perspective, or rather what an emotion should be considered according to a *scientific* perspective [@scarantinoHowDefineEmotions2012; @fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005].

From a pure usability standpoint, that is, the perspective of a learner that must face a tool she is not used to have in a learning environment, a *folk* perspective should not be discarded as simplistic. For instance, an EAT could be based on the most frequent affective states encountered by learners [@dmelloSelectiveMetaanalysisRelative2013; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @reisAffectiveStatesComputersupported2018, see also previous chapter], without any relationship with a prescriptive definition, and regardless of whether these states are more or less prototypical of emotion [@fehrConceptEmotionViewed1984; @scarantinoDonGiveBasic2011]. Even more bluntly, an EAT could avoid the problem altogether by prompting users to share *what they think an emotion is*, letting them construe the meaning of how they feel without any guidance [@barrettKnowingWhatYou2001; @barrettSolvingEmotionParadox2006; @russellCoreAffectPsychological2003]. On the other hand, from a multipurpose point of view -- which is in and on itself a form of generalization -- the link with a *scientific*, theory-driven perspective presents several advantages.

First, by mapping the tool to a prescriptive definition, emotion not only emerges according to what it *is*, but also according to what it *does* and why. As seen in the previous chapter, there is a growing body of literature focusing on the functional role emotion plays both at the intra- and inter-personal levels [@adolphsInvestigatingEmotionsFunctional2018; @fischerSocialFunctionsEmotion2016; @keltnerSocialFunctionsEmotions1999; @levensonIntrapersonalFunctionsEmotion1999; @leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987]. Thus, a theory-driven perspective may contribute to better assemble these functions and take full advantage of them in the implementation of the EAT [@broschAppraisingBrainNeuroCognitive2013; @pekrunProgressOpenProblems2005; @vankleefInterpersonalDynamicsEmotion2018].

Second, tailoring an EAT on emotion theory may contribute to guide learners in discovering and using it, since they can be both interested and reassured by identifying underlying mechanisms that are thought to be an integral part of the phenomenon [see for instance @tranEmotionsDecisionMakingProcesses2012 for an applied example]. As illustrated in the previous chapter, the fact that a dedicated tool is provided in the environment for some *corollary* activities does not automatically mean that it will be adopted [@kreijnsIdentifyingPitfallsSocial2003].

Third, from a research perspective, linking the EAT to a theory facilitates the assessment and comparison of measures collected through or about it, and therefore foster common ground in the contributions that shall decide to adopt it [@izardManyMeaningsAspects2010; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. In the meantime, the EAT would also benefit from the upcoming theoretical and applied contributions in the literature that relate to the shared emotion theory, ensuring the tool can progress over time, or otherwise be dismissed if some competing theory shall provide a better alternative [@fergusonVastGraveyardUndead2012; @meehlAppraisingAmendingTheories1990].

These reasons advocate the adoption of a theory-driven approach to emotion definition. The next section will thus address the topic of emotion theories.

## Theories of Emotion

As one may expect from the complexity in defining an emotion outlined in the previous section, there are a multitude of emotion theories and taxonomies that try to categorize them [for a recent overview, see @moorsTheoriesEmotionCausation2009; @sep-emotion; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013]. Adopting a perspective spanning philosophy and affective sciences, Scarantino and de Sousa [-@sep-emotion] identify three traditions in which most of emotion theories can be divided in: (1) the Feeling Tradition, which considers the conscious experience of an emotion as the fundamental characteristic; (2) the Evaluative Tradition, which focuses on how emotion consists in, or is crucially defined by the way eliciting events are evaluated; and (3) the Motivational Tradition, which identifies emotion with specific internal states driven by want or need to satisfy a goal.

In psychology more specifically, the last decades have been characterized mainly by three major families of emotion theories that account for the *whole* emotional phenomenon : (1) basic emotion theories [@ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992; @ekmanWhatMeantCalling2011; @huttoNewBetterBET2018; @keltnerEmotionalExpressionAdvances2019], (2) constructivist/dimensional emotion theories [@russellCoreAffectPsychological2003; @russellEmotionCoreAffect2009; @stanleyTwodimensionalAffectiveSpace2009], and (3) appraisal emotion theories [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985]. These three families emerged from different historical backgrounds, and the foundation are often rooted in philosophical perspectives with secular traditions. In *psychological* era, we can trace back seminal works on the three families in the second half of the last century [@arnoldEmotionPersonalityPsychological1960; @lazarusPsychologicalStressCoping1966; @russellCircumplexModelAffect1980; @schererEmotionProcessFunction1982]. Since then, theories have influenced each other, converging on some points -- most notably the fact that emotion is not unitary but comprises different components -- and maintaining different positions on other points, such as eliciting and differentiation mechanisms in discrete emotions [@frijdaEmotionDefinitionsPsychological2009; @sanderModelsEmotionAffective2013]. New and often interdisciplinary theories that have emerged lately resume and extends some ideas of one or more of these families, as in the *enacting* approach proposed by Colombetti [-@colombettiFeelingBodyAffective2014] or the *theory of affective pragmatics* proposed by Scarantino [-@scarantinoHowThingsEmotional2017]. In other cases, such as in the *theory of constructed emotion* advocated by Feldman Barrett [@barrettHowEmotionsAre2018; @barrettSolvingEmotionParadox2006; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017], there is considerable discontinuity with previous work,challenging the principle according to which emotions are responses or exist as natural kinds. For instance, Feldman Barret [-@barrettHowEmotionsAre2018, p. vii-viii] argues that "[e]motion are real, but not in the objective sense that molecules or neurons are real. They are real in the same sense that money is real -- that is, hardly an illusion, but a product of human agreement". Some contributions have also attempted to adopt a theory-independent perspective, focusing on empirical contributions by investigating the accuracy in making predictions about the emotion experienced by a person in a controlled environment [@schererEmotionProcessEvent2019].

A second important choice in the implementation of a theory-driven EAT is therefore to define which emotion theory or set of theories it refers to, trying as much as possible to connect extant theories straightforwardly and unambiguously. In this intent, the broad criterion of selection adopted consists in considering theories that explicitly belong to, or are compatible with, the Evaluative Tradition, and more specifically appraisal theories of emotion. It is posited by this choice that an EAT may best serve its purpose in conveying instrumental information to learners, if that information is crucially determined by how learners construe emotion meaning from the situation at hand [@lavoueEmotionAwarenessTools2020; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013; @pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014]. The next section offers an overview of what characterizes this family of emotion theories.

## Appraisal Theories of Emotion

Appraisal theories of emotion originated in the 1960's with the work of Arnold [-@arnoldEmotionPersonalityPsychological1960] and Lazarus [-@lazarusPsychologicalStressCoping1966] and were then formalized in the 1980's by independent scholars reaching similar conclusions about the need to explain how different emotion may be elicited by the same event, for different persons and in different situations [@schererEmotionProcessFunction1982; @smithPatternsCognitiveAppraisal1985; @schorrAppraisalEvolutionIdea2001; @rosemanAppraisalTheoryOverview2001; @siemerSameSituationdifferentEmotions2007]. The core element shared by theories belonging to the appraisal family is resumed by the premise that emotions "are adaptive responses which reflect appraisals of features of the environment that are significant for the organism's well-being" [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013, p. 119], where well-being roughly encompasses the satisfaction or obstruction of someone's wants, needs or goals that are considered of major concern [@frijdaEmotions1986; @rosemanAppraisalTheoryOverview2001; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. This feature is nevertheless not unique to appraisal theories, since other theories reckon adaptive functions to emotion or motivational implications [@adolphsNeuroscienceEmotionNew2018; @ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992; @scarantinoHowThingsEmotional2017; @sep-emotion]. Appraisal theories are therefore more thoroughly characterized by the dynamic, recurrent and ongoing nature they confer to emotion in sustaining the adaptive response [@broschAppraisingBrainNeuroCognitive2013; @oatleyCognitiveApproachesEmotions2014; @rosemanAppraisalTheoryOverview2001; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schorrAppraisalEvolutionIdea2001; @siemerSameSituationdifferentEmotions2007]. It is in fact common among appraisal theories to consider emotion as a process, rather than a state (*ibid.*). The bounded process unfolds over brief periods of time and can be modified in light of new information coming from any of the organismic subsystems or components, which include "an appraisal component with evaluations of the environment and the person--environment interaction; a motivational component with action tendencies or other forms of action readiness; a somatic component with peripheral physiological responses; a motor component with expressive and instrumental behavior; and a feeling component with subjective experience or feelings" [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013, pp. 119-120].

An example of a concrete theory may contribute to better frame the mechanism, which is here limited to the appraisal component (more about this will follow). The example is taken from Pekrun's Control-Value theory of achievement emotion [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006], already sketched in the previous chapter, which provides three key elements from an illustrative purpose. First, it directly relates to learning, which fits with the thesis's applied context. Second, it proposes a reduced number of appraisal criteria compared to other theories (more on this later). Third, the appraisals are not *valence* and *arousal*, which are ubiquitous dimensions in constructivist/dimensional theories [@russellCircumplexModelAffect1980; @russellEmotionCoreAffect2009; @stanleyTwodimensionalAffectiveSpace2009], whereas in appraisal theories may have important, but not mandatory status [@fontaineWorldEmotionsNot2007; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. In Pekrun's own words (*ibid*, p. 317):

> The control-value theory described here posits that two groups of appraisals are of specific relevance for achievement emotions: (1) *subjective control* over achievement activities and their outcomes (e.g., expectations that persistence at studying can be enacted, and that it will lead to success); and (2) the *subjective values* of these activities and outcomes (e.g., the perceived importance of success).

What emotion a learner will feel in an achievement context, such as studying for a test, will depend on the specific pattern emerging from the combination of appraising the subjective control and the subjective value. For instance, "[i]f an achievement activity (e.g., studying) and the material to which it relates (e.g., learning material) are positively valued, and if the activity is perceived as being sufficiently controllable by the self, *enjoyment* is assumed to be instigated" (*ibid.*, p. 323). Conversely, "[i]f the activity is perceived as being controllable, but is negatively valued (e.g., when effort required by the activity is experienced as aversive), *anger* is expected to be aroused. If the activity is not sufficiently controllable, *frustration* will be experienced" (*ibid*, p. 323, all italics in the text).

According to the dynamic, recursive and ongoing nature of emotion posited by appraisal theories, then, the evaluation of the activity may change instantly. For instance, the learning material may be perceived as too difficult at first, lowering learners' subjective control, but become clearer after a synthesis or a figure. Likewise, the subjective value may suddenly arise if, after reading a few pages useless to one's needs, the learner finds a passage she can directly apply to solve a problem that has been bothering her ever since. Conversely, the very same passage may be considered of scarce value from her colleague, who has already solved the problem beforehand.

The Control-Value theory of achievement emotions may therefore seem to be a valid candidate to guide the implementation of an appraisal-driven EAT, but it only partially comply with the multipurpose vocation. In fact, learning is characterized by different *kinds* of emotion, which comprise, but are not limited to, achievement emotions. As illustrated in the previous chapter, Pekrun and Linnerbrink-Garcia [-@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014] reckon that learning also triggers epistemic emotions, topic emotions, and social emotions. An overarching appraisal theory would therefore be more suitable to a multipurpose EAT. In this regard, appraisal theories, even if they share considerable overlapping, differ on several key points, which are enumerated in a recent state of the art proposed by @moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013. Most of the points are too detailed for the present purpose and the complete list would lack instrumental information to be fully explained. Only the points concerning appraisal criteria are considered to be of primary relevance and will thus be extrapolated by the aforementioned source.

As a reminder, appraisal is considered a process that scans events outside or inside the organism and evaluates them against a set of criteria related to the organism's major concern. One of the main source of divergence in appraisal theories refers, precisely, to the number of appraisal criteria the event is evaluated against, the order of evaluation, as well as the possible outcomes of every criterion. An appraisal criterion can have dimensional, ordinal or categorical values. For instance, the Control-Value theory described above [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006] considers that the two appraisals control and value can assume ordinal values *none*, *low*, *medium* and *high*. Other appraisal theories postulate dimensional criteria, with potentially infinite values along a continuum, or categorical, with a predefined set of possible values. Pekrun could have hypothesized, for instance, that subjective control ranges from *entirely uncontrollable* to *entirely controllable*, or categorized the appraisal in a dichotomous *not controllable* and *controllable*. As stated by [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013]:

> The number and nature of the appraisal variables and/or values is closely related to the number and nature of the emotions that one can or wishes to explain. In general, more emotions require more appraisal variables and/or more appraisal values. Turning it around, more appraisal variables and/or more appraisal values allow more variety in emotions. Two appraisal variables with two values each can account for four emotions. Seven appraisal variables with an infinite number of values each can account for an infinite number of emotions. The number and nature of the emotions that one wishes to explain can be traced back to metatheoretical choices such as whether one strives for parsimony and/or a focus on natural language descriptors of emotions, on the one hand, or exhaustiveness and/or a focus on variety, on the other hand. --- [@moorsAppraisalTheoriesEmotion2013, p. 121-122]

It is posited here that a multipurpose EAT may benefit from the greatest possible variation. Standing at information provided by the cited article, the appraisal theory which provides the greatest variety is the Component Process Model theoretical framework [@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005], which will thus be adopted as primary reference and is illustrated at length in the next subsection.

## The Component Process Model Theoretical Framework

The Component Process Model (CPM) is a theoretical framework bridging appraisal and componential approaches to emotion, first proposed by Scherer [-@schererEmotionProcessFunction1982] in the 1980's and then refined over the years [-@schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013; -@schererWhatAreEmotions2005; -@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; -@schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009]. It has been applied to different contexts: the reader may find recent discussions of the model in relation with learning and education in @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014, with affective computing in @schererBlueprintAffectiveComputing2010, with emotional meaning-making in @fontaineComponentsEmotionalMeaning2013, with emotional competence/intelligence in @schererComponentialEmotionTheory2007, and with neuroscience in @sanderAppraisalDrivenComponentialApproach2018. An overarching and accessible description of the model can be found in @schererWhatAreEmotions2005, whereas @schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001 and @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009 are more focused on the dynamic, recurrent and ongoing features of the model. Finally, recent developments are discussed in @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013. 

This section first proposes an overview of model and its components according to the objectives of the thesis by combining a computational [@schererComponentProcessModel2010], emotion meaning-making [@schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018] and voluntary self-report [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005] perspectives.

### Overall Description of the Model

The CPM adopts a functional perspective according to which "[e]motions have developed in the course of evolution to replace rigid instincts or stimulus-response chains by a mechanism that allows flexible adaptation to environmental contingencies by decoupling stimulus and response, creating a latency time for response optimization" [@schererComponentProcessModel2010, p. 48]. Response optimization emerges as the result from the synchronization of five organismic subsystems performing specific functions. The state of each subsystem during an emotion episode corresponds to one of the five components of the model, namely: (1) the cognitive, (2) the neurophysiological, (3) the motivational, (4) the motor expression, and (2) the subjective feeling components. Table \@ref(tab:tf-cpm-components-table) lists the full association between functions, organismic subsystems, and emotion component in the model. According to the CPM, thus, an emotion is defined as "*an episode of interrelated, synchronized changes in the states of all or most of the five organismic subsystems in response to the evaluation of an external or internal stimulus event as relevant to major concerns of the organism*" [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005, p. 697, italic in the text].

  )
```

The CPM belongs to the appraisal family of emotion theories because it states that the coordination and synchronization of the components during an emotion episode is driven by the cognitive evaluation of the situation, that is, by how the situation is subjectively appraised by the person [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. The five components intertwine so that a variation in one fo them may lead to modifications in others, modifiyng thus the net effect of the coordination and synchronization. As stated by Scherer [-@schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013]:

>Briefly put, the CPM suggests that the event and its consequences are appraised with a set of criteria on multiple levels of processing, producing a motivational effect or action tendency that often changes or at least modifies the status quo. Specifically, the appraisal results and the concomitant motivational changes will produce efferent effects in the autonomic nervous system (in the form of somatovisceral changes), and motor expressions are centrally represented and constantly fused in a multimodal integration area (with continuous updating as events and appraisals change). Parts of this central integrated representation may then become conscious and subject to assignment to fuzzy emotion categories, as well as being labeled with emotion words, expressions, or metaphors --- @schererMeasuringMeaningEmotion2013, p. 13

The process can be understood in terms of input/output when the model is organized in three modules, as graphically represented in Figure \@ref(fig:tf-cpm-general-model-adapted-caption), adapted from @schererComponentProcessModel2010: (1) the appraisal module, (2) the response-patterning module, and (3) the integration/categorization module. From the left-hand side of the model, an event, behavior or situation (the input) is subject to a multilevel appraisal, that is, cognitively evaluated against a number of appraisal criteria. This evaluation leads to the patterning of a response, which comprises three out of the five organismic subsystems: (a) the motivational component, which prepares the organism to action, even if this action is not necessarily executed; (b) the neurophysiological component, which orchestrates the allocation of resources accordingly; and (c) the motor expression component, which is responsible of the emergence of the underlying process to the *surface* via efferent manifestations, providing communicative cues, such as facial expressions, vocal prosody, or body postures. Finally, in the integration/categorization module on the right-hand side, the whole process -- that is, the net effect of the appraisal and response-patterning -- is integrated in a central representation, the feeling, of which the person may or may not be conscious. If she is conscious, the person may recur to her emotional lexicon in an effort to label the feeling, which in that case becomes the subjective feeling, that is, the output of the conscious output of the whole process.

```

After a brief overview of the overall model, the next subsections focus on the three modules respectively. 

### The Appraisal Module: Appraisals as Sequential Evaluation Checks

The appraisal module may be considered the most characteristic of the CPM for two intertwined reasons. First, it bridges cognition and emotion in a functional perspective [@leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987], avoiding thus the pitfalls of the opposition between affective and cognitive, which recent developments in affective science are progressively dismissing in favor of interacting or even integrating perspectives [@dukesRiseAffectivism2021; @pessoaCognitiveemotionalBrainInteractions2013]. Second, it plays a pivotal role in differentiating the CPM from other appraisal theories (see above), for the CPM makes bold assumptions about how distinctive appraisal patterns lead to distinctive emotional episodes [@schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererHumanEmotionExperiences2013; @schererStudyingEmotionantecedentAppraisal1993; @schererEmotionProcessEvent2019]. In other words, the model explicitly assume a causal mechanism instantiated by the appraisal module, which determines the unfolding emotional episode in terms of response-patterning and integration/categorization.

The CPM's appraisal module is built around the central notion of Sequential Evaluation Check (SEC), that is, a set of appraisal criteria the event, situation or behavior is evaluated against [@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013]. According to the CPM, these appraisal criteria can not only be enumerated, but also determined with respect to their timing in achieving *preliminary closure* in information processing, that is, before the result of the evaluation can be integrated by other SECs or components of the model in the unfolding emotional process [see @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013 for a recent discussion]. The CPM identifies a total of 13 SECs, listed in Table ..., which can be grouped in correspondence with four major appraisal objectives in adapting to a given event [@schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009; @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013]:

* *Relevance*: how relevant is this event for me?
* *Implications/Consequences*: what are the implications or consequences of this event and how do they affect my well-being and my immediate or long-term goals?
* *Coping potential*: how well can I cope with or adjust to these consequences?
* *Normative significance*: what is the significance of this event for my self-concept and for social norms and value?

(ref:tf-cpm-secs-caption) Stimulus evaluation checks, organized in four groups, illustrated with typical features describing the event or the effects on the person. Retrieved from original Table 1 in @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013, p. 151

    "Person can control the consequences of the event",
    "Person has power over the consequences of the event",
    "Person can live with the consequences of the event",
    "Event incongruent with own standards and self-ideals",
    "Event violated laws or socially accepted norms"
  )

The evaluation of SECs can be executed at various levels of processing [@leventhalRelationshipEmotionCognition1987], recently identified by Scherer [-@schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013] in four levels: 

>I have further developed the notion of levels of processing and now postulate four such levels (entailing different neural structures and circuits): (a) a low sensorimotor level with a pattern-matching mechanism that is largely genetically determined, using criteria consisting of appropriate templates; (b) a schematic level, based on memory traces from social learning processes and occurring in a fairly automatic, unconscious fashion; (c) an association level, involving various cortical association areas, which may occur automatically and unconsciously or in a deliberate, conscious fashion; and (d) a conceputal level, involving propositional knowledge and underlying cultural meaning systems, requiring consciousness and effortful calculations in prefrontal cortical areas. --- @schererNatureDynamicsRelevance2013, p.151

Furthermore, appraisal criteria are also bidirectionally linked with cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and reasoning, as well as motivational factors and self-concepts (see @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009). As a consequence, the specific appraisal pattern that emerges is determined by situational factors, but also by more stable structures that can lead to certain patterns to emerge more or less frequently (*e.g.*, the tendency of a student to avoid public speaking as a result of past experiences). In the meantime, the fact that many elements concur in determining the specific appraisal profile implies that an evaluation may cause the emotional episode to derail from adaptive binaries and lead to inefficient or even harming responses to events, as in the case of excessive anxiety or fear in taking an exam [@pekrunControlValueTheoryAchievement2006; @shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014].

To sum up, in the CPM appraisal criteria play a prominent role in emotion elicitation and differentiation. As a consequence, an EAT could leverage on the pivotal role of SECs to foster emotional awareness, for instance advocating the cognitive evaluation of the salient event. In other words, the EAT could contribute to make sure that emotion is assessed at the conceptual level -- the one implicating consciousness and effortful calculations -- as a means to extrapolate meaning-making from the adaptive objectives of appraisal criteria.

### The Response-Patterning Module: Efferent Manifestations and Action Tendencies

The response-patterning module uses information provided by the appraisal module, that is, the specific profile of sequential evaluation checks described in the previous subsection, to organize three emotion components: the motivational, the neurophysiological, and the motor expression components. The neurophysiological component, though, is beyond the scope of a parsimonious EAT, because awareness coming from this component would require dedicated hardware for detection of neurophysiological signals such as skin conductance, heart rate, and the like. Similarly, the motor expression component is linked to efferent manifestations such as facial expression, vocal prosody, or body posture, whose awareness would once again require dedicated hardware such as audio/video connection, and eventually dedicated software for autonomic emotion recognition. Even though these techniques exists and are deployed, especially in the context of affective systems (see previous chapter), they are not considered for the purpose of the present contribution. This is an opinionated choice, dictated primarily by the desire to provide a parsimonious tool, requiring minimal hardware configuration to maximize portability and adaptability to different contexts. The choice is nevertheless supported by an ongoing debate about what people can actually infer from efferent manifestation of emotions [@hyniewskaNaturalisticEmotionDecoding2019; @schererFacialExpressionsAllow2007; @shumanEmotionPerceptionComponential2017]. Recent contributions (*ibid*) have highlighted mixed results and methodological issues in investigating the matter (*e.g.*, the use of actors' facial expressions rather than naturalistic exposure), calling for the need of further investigation. In other words, it is not given to know, from the extant literature, what learners' miss, if they are not provided with efferent manifestations that are normally available in face-to-face interactions. Far from being an indication that efferent manifestations are useless, this fact is at least a warrant that attepts to provide emotional awareness in computer-mediated environment with alternatives to seamless audio/video connection are not *a priori* doomed to fail [@derksRoleEmotionComputermediated2008; @parkinsonEmotionsDirectRemote2008].

The motivational component, on the other hand, requires some consideration, especially since *motivation* is a concept tightly related to emotion (see for instance the Motivational Tradition cited above), especially in learning context, where sometimes it is even used interchangeably with emotion [@linnenbrink-garciaAdaptiveMotivationEmotion2016; @pekrunIntroductionEmotionsEducation2014].

The complexity and diversity in the field of emotion theories is reflected in different approaches on how emotions should be assessed and measured [@boehnerHowEmotionMade2007; @cerneaSurveyTechnologiesRise2015; @maussMeasuresEmotionReview2009; @mortillaroEmotionsMethodsAssessment2015; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. In a componential approach to emotion, ideally, all aspects of the synchronized and unfolding process should be taken into account [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005]. Measuring all these aspects at once, though, requires dedicated material, some of which is difficult or impossible to deploy outside a laboratory. Self-report remains therefore a widely adopted method to ask a person about her emotional experience, either through *paper-and-pencil-like* questionnaire  [e.g. @harmon-jonesDiscreteEmotionsQuestionnaire2016; @pekrunMeasuringEmotionsEpistemic2016], or more elaborated self-report tools [see among others @broekensAffectButtonMethodReliable2013; @desmet2003measuring; @schererWhatAreEmotions2005;  @siegertAppropriateEmotionalLabelling2011; @bradleyMeasuringEmotionSelfAssessment1994; @caicedoHowYouFeel2006; @isomursuExperimentalEvaluationFive2007; @molinariEMORELOutilReporting2016].  With respect to more elaborate tools in particular, Scherer [-@schererWhatAreEmotions2005, p. 721] advocates some of the characteristics an emotion self-report tool should provide:

* Concentrate on the feeling component of emotion;
* Avoid the simple valence-arousal space;
* Rely on natural language labels;
* Allow the assessment of the intensity of the feeling;
* Build some emotion structure into the instrument, rather than presenting arbitrary emotion sets;
* Adopt a user-friendly graphical user interface.

Driven by these tenets, Scherer [-@schererWhatAreEmotions2005] developed and refined over the years [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013] one of the most widely adopted emotion self-report tool: the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW). For instance, the GEW is also presented in an overarching chapter [@shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014] about emotion in the *International Handbook of Emotions in Education* [@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014], which is, to the best of my knowledge, the most up-to-date and comprehensive resource about emotion in education.

The GEW is an instrumental implementation of the Component Process Model theoretical framework [CPM; @sanderAppraisalDrivenComponentialApproach2018; @schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001; @schererDynamicArchitectureEmotion2009]. It combines the two most widely adopted approaches to emotion self-report -- the dimensional and discrete emotions approaches [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005] -- by establishing a causal link between the appraisal [@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001] and the subjective feeling [@grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008] components -- that is, between the cognitive evaluation of the situation and the holistic experience that usually emerges to consciousness as a natural language word or idiom. This direct link is corroborated by recent empirical contributions investigating whether the emotional meaning of words often adopted, in different cultures, to express emotional experiences can be traced back to specific evaluations of the eliciting event [@fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @fontaineWhyWhatHow2013; @gentschEffectsAchievementContexts2017; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018].

include_graphics(here("figure/dew/gew-v3.png"))
```

The interface of the GEW, depicted in its third version in Figure \@ref(fig:gew-version-3-figure) [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013], presents 20 subjective feelings -- chosen with respect to their frequency in emotion literature and everyday language use -- organized in a circumplex, which is determined by two appraisal dimensions as axes: *Valence* on the abscissa and *Control/Power* on the ordinate. Each feeling is positioned according to a value along both axes and belongs thus to one of the four quadrants of the circumplex, determined by the combination of positive or negative Valence, and positive or negative Control/Power. From the origin of the axes stem 5 circles for each of the subjective feelings. The circles grow in size as they get closer to the edge of the circumplex, so that the first circle is the smallest, and the last one the biggest. Users can therefore choose, first, the *row* of circles that corresponds to the subjective feeling they are experiencing and, second, the intensity of the feeling as a function of the circle's size.

## A Working Definition of Emotion

*x* is an emotion only *if*

1. *x* is an affective *episode*
2. x has the property of intentionality (i.e., of being directed)
3. x contains bodily changes (arousal, expression, etc.) that are felt
4. x contains a perceptual or intellectual episode, y, which has the property of intentionality 
5. the intentionality of x is inherited from the intentionality of y
6. x is triggered by at least one appraisal
7. x is guided by at least one appraisal
