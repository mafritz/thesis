# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

I posited that the whole concept of emotional awareness could be better grasped if learners (1) reflect on their emotion from a subjective feeling experience rather than autonomic recognition; (2) guide their reflection on the appraisal of a situation and convey emotional awareness to others using the same information unity they have used to extrapolate meaning-making from the situation at hand; and (3) dispose of emotional awareness on a moment-by-moment basis, which bestow to learners the responsibility of producing and perusing emotional information at the moment the see fit.

## Limitations

### Where Is Learning in All This?

-   Studies vary in emotional awareness and learning tasks, attempt to hold one of them constant

-   Difficulty to find a middle ground for representation of learning (small tasks or all courses)

-   

### Limited Empirical Data

-   Started mainly in CSCL context following previous work

-   Planned experience could not be carried out

-   Focus on the Toolbox

### Few Researchers Implicated So Far

-   Big error from user-centered design

-   Researchers often seek :

    -    a custom implementation of "simple" data collection

    -   a tool that is tightly integrated with the learning environment

-   Is there really an interest for a decoupled tool ?

## Future Perspectives

### Technical Improvements to the EAT

-   Usability test, Focus groups, ...

-   Work on graphical representations

### Further Empirical Adoption of the EAT

-   Scripting vs. Awareness strategy
