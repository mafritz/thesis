# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

I posited that the whole concept of emotional awareness could be better grasped if learners (1) reflect on their emotion from a subjective feeling experience rather than autonomic recognition; (2) guide their reflection on the appraisal of a situation and convey emotional awareness to others using the same information unity they have used to extrapolate meaning-making from the situation at hand; and (3) dispose of emotional awareness on a moment-by-moment basis, which bestow to learners the responsibility of producing and perusing emotional information at the moment the see fit.
