This chapter illustrates a first attempt to implement an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) with the main characteristics put forward in the introduction conducted as part of the Emotion Awareness Tool for Computer-Mediated Interactions (EATMINT) project [@avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @cereghettiSharingEmotionsComputermediated2015; @Chanel2013; @chanelGrandChallengeProblem2016; @fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015; @fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. The tool, named Dynamic Emotion Wheel [@fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015; @fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015] is deeply inspired by the Geneva Emotion Wheel, a self-report tool rooted in the Component Process Model introduced in the previous chapter.

The project, which was part of the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) *Affective Sciences*, had two intertwined objectives:

1.  Designing Emotion Awareness Tools, which allow either the explicit or the autonomic sharing of emotions in computer-mediated interaction;
2.  Studying the impact of emotional awareness on collaboration both at intra- and inter-personal levels, with respect to the emergence of strategies that improve collaboration such as monitoring, regulating and reflecting on emotions.
