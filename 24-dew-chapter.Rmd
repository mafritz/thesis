This chapter illustrates a first attempt to implement an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) with the main characteristics put forward in the introduction conducted as part of the Emotion Awareness Tool for Computer-Mediated Interactions (EATMINT) project [@avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020; @avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020; @cereghettiSharingEmotionsComputermediated2015; @Chanel2013; @chanelGrandChallengeProblem2016; @fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015; @fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015; @molinariEmotionFeedbackComputermediated2013]. The tool, named Dynamic Emotion Wheel [@fritzDynamicEmotionWheel2015; @fritzReinventingWheelEmotional2015] is deeply inspired by the Geneva Emotion Wheel, a self-report tool rooted in the Component Process Model introduced in the previous chapter.

The project, which was part of the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) *Affective Sciences*, had two intertwined objectives:

1.  Designing Emotion Awareness Tools, which allow either the explicit or the autonomic sharing of emotions in computer-mediated interaction;
2.  Studying the impact of emotional awareness on collaboration both at intra- and inter-personal levels, with respect to the emergence of strategies that improve collaboration such as monitoring, regulating and reflecting on emotions.

## The Geneva Emotion Wheel

> The design characteristics for the instrument to be developed are as follows:
>
> -   concentrating on the feeling component of emotion, in the sense of qualia, rather than asking respondents to judge concrete response characteristics such as sympathetic arousal;
> -   going beyond a simple valence-arousal space in order to be better able to differentiate qualitatively different states that share the same region in this space;
> -   relying on standard emotion labels in natural languages in order to capitalize on respondents' intuitive understanding of the semantic field;
> -   allowing systematic assessment of the intensity of the feeling;
> -   going beyond the arbitrariness of choosing different sets of emotion terms and presenting them in very unsystematic fashion by building some emotion structure into the instrument;
> -   presenting the instrument in a graphical form that is userfriendly, allowing the respondent to rapidly understand the principle and use the instrument in a reliable fashion. --- @schererWhatAreEmotions2005, p. 721

Driven by these tenets, Scherer [-@schererWhatAreEmotions2005] developed and refined over the years [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013] one of the most widely adopted emotion self-report tool: the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW). For instance, the GEW is also presented in an overarching chapter [@shumanConceptsStructuresEmotions2014] about emotion in the *International Handbook of Emotions in Education* [@pekrunInternationalHandbookEmotions2014], which is, to the best of my knowledge, the most up-to-date and comprehensive resource about emotion in education. The GEW is an instrumental implementation of the Component Process Model theoretical framework illustrated above. It combines the two most widely adopted approaches to emotion self-report -- the dimensional and discrete emotions approaches [@schererWhatAreEmotions2005] -- by establishing a causal link between the appraisal [@schererAppraisalConsideredProcess2001] and the subjective feeling [@grandjeanConsciousEmotionalExperience2008] components -- that is, between the cognitive evaluation of the situation and the holistic experience that usually emerges to consciousness as a natural language word or idiom. This direct link is also corroborated by recent empirical contributions investigating whether the emotional meaning of words often adopted, in different cultures, to express emotional experiences can be traced back to specific evaluations of the eliciting event [@fontaineGlobalMeaningStructure2013; @fontaineWhyWhatHow2013; @gentschEffectsAchievementContexts2017; @gilliozMappingEmotionTerms2016; @schererSemanticStructureEmotion2018].

```

The interface of the GEW, depicted in its third version in Figure \@ref(fig:gew-version-3-figure) [@schererGRIDMeetsWheel2013], presents 20 subjective feelings -- chosen with respect to their frequency in emotion literature and everyday language use -- organized in a circumplex, which is determined by two appraisal dimensions as axes: *Valence* on the abscissa and *Control/Power* on the ordinate. Each feeling is positioned according to a value along both axes and belongs thus to one of the four quadrants of the circumplex, determined by the combination of positive or negative Valence, and positive or negative Control/Power. From the origin of the axes stem 5 circles for each of the subjective feelings. The circles grow in size as they get closer to the edge of the circumplex, so that the first circle is the smallest, and the last one the biggest. Users can therefore choose, first, the *row* of circles that corresponds to the subjective feeling they are experiencing and, second, the intensity of the feeling as a function of the circle's size.
